A Good and Caring Company|I've been working for Group Health Sales for a couple years and can't say that I've ever been happier with any other employer. It's a very caring organization from the top down. Even with the restructuring going due to the Kaiser Permanente acquisition, management old and new seem to have the employees best interests in mind. New opportunities and enhancements for members and employees seem to be on the horizon.|None substantial enough to write about.|Keep up the good work. Transparency about incoming changes is key.|5.0
Analyst|It is a good company to work for. Good work life balance. The diversity and integration culture is great in CA. Good fitness class onsite!!!!!|Not much diversity in GA.

This is a set back because managers spent excessive time reading emails and prioritizing them to daily deadlines.|If leadership wants managers to prioritize efficiently and effectively, provide them cell phones so that they sort and plan ahead before getting into the offices.

KP is definitely one of the best employers out here!|The pay is amazing, no company in my area can compare. You can easily make 50k to 100k with no degree by working overtime in the KP call centers.

Oh and you get tuition reimbursement along with education hours to use when you have to go to school.|When you’re ready to move on from any department it’s all seniority based so make sure you have years under your belt otherwise you won’t make the cut.

Director-Diablo Service Area|at first the pay seems to be a pro-however the expectation to work more than 50 hours per week and 7 days a week it does not add up.

Favoritism among Senior Leaders--its not what you know it is who you know. Upper education has no value- hire people they like but are not qualified.As a patient the money you pay is wasted on meetings, lunches the union. None of this has proven to improve employee morale. All the data shared is skewed, erase the ""bad"" data to make it look better. It is a terrible place to receive care"|Take sexual harassment training seriously.

I believe it is double per hr what the average is.|Call center writes up agents and investigates them if they call out sick, even once a month despite a doctor's note. After four write ups, you are terminated. It is a super fast pace environment. Most agents are stressed and on fmla or leave. Seems like this toxic environment is only at the call center because employees express their happiness at other kp departments. The CC has a rap around kp to be an extremely difficult and stressful place to work. Would not recommend.|Management is cut throats and practices favoritism. Treatment isn't fair across the board. One agent gets written up while another does the same thing and mgnt turns a blind eye. Entire management needs to be replaced.|1.0

Don't do it|They pay bi-monthly, direct deposit.|It's a degrading place to work. It's very tribal and cliqueish. If you aren't part of their tribe, you know it, are excluded, and don't get to share in the 'bonus's, promotions, favorite plum jobs, etc.. It is the MOST UNFAIR PLACE i have ever worked. THERE IS NO FAIRNESS. You cannot complain, either, because if you do, they punish you severely. If you file a complaint, with 'dispute resolution', you are marked to be 'fired'. FOR SURE. There is RAMPANT SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION AND HARRASSMENT, but you cannot fight back, because Kaiser Permanente is a private company, and forces everyone into 'FORCED ARBITRATION', where they almost always WIN. You have no rights! If you want to shorten your life span, you can go work there, but everything they tell you up front, is a lie, and you WANT TO BELIEVE THE LIE, so you go there to work, and pretty soon, you believe the lies, and should quit, but you don't. I wasted my time, and my life there. My best advice, DON'T BE TEMPTED!|to management: Don't screw over people just to please upper management! You are spreading bad 'karma', and you'll regret it later.|1.0

Kaiser Permanente is a great company to work for. They offer great pay and is expanding.|Great place to work. Great workplace culture. Great best practices workplace environment. Up to date technology used in patient care. Compensation is very high and they have great benefits. Union operation. There are opportunities for growth in different areas around pharmacy.|Overly fast paced. If you thought CVS was fast, then check out here. The problem with this system of getting patients out in 5 minutes at the larger facilities is unrealistic. The staff is literally running all day. If Medicine is coming out of the machine, pharmacists may scan the bottle label before seeing the drug just to meet the target goal. If the member is a waiter, Upper management ding you if the member doesn’t check out within that targeted time frame. I have seen some staff members chase members down to get them to check out. It shouldn’t be that way. You can’t force a member to stay in the lobby to check out. The targeted goal in large facilities is just unrealistic.PRN Pharmacist scheduling uses stafferlink to select your availability and the location you would like to work, however one manager has total control and picks where they want you to go.|Each manager over each facility should be granted the authority to schedule their own PRNs when needed. The current system of having one manager responsible for all of the scheduling as well as run their own facility not only creates biases with leadership conducted emotionally, but the scheduling always end up being last minute. This is proof that it is overwhelming for one manager to run a facility and their staff as well as hold a responsibility for scheduling PRNs to other facilities. Most positions stay pending for weeks without approval at some facilities. As a result, the PRN that applied for the position weeks ago, doesn’t get scheduled until the day of and end up getting called in in the middle of the shift. This not only can affect the numbers and target goals but it can also be risky in securing someone to work. This is why each pharmacy manager should the authority to schedule at their given facility. The promise to allow a Pharmacist to work up to 120 hours a month should be upheld if the Pharmacist is willing and available.|4.0

Reflection after 10+ Years of Employment|Great Salaries - Kaiser Permanente pays very well for a non-profit company. Pay is very competitive against for-profit companies.Great Benefits - Kaiser Permanente treats their employees very well in terms of health benefits and dental benefits. Reasonable rates very low copayments. Recently started to offer long-term disability insurance, pet insurance, and law services for a reduced rate.Great PTO Benefits - The longer that you are employed with Kaiser the faster you accrue PTO. At 10+ years, you accrue 25 PTO days per year + paid holidays.Good mobility - Kaiser is a huge organization so there is good mobility between departments and organizations.|"Workload - While Kaiser Permanente is a non-profit, the company expects you to work like a billable consultant. Depending on your role, you may have to constantly travel, work 65+ hours a week, and have little work-and-life balance. Discussions with management about workloads are often ignored/minimized.Stuck with the Kaiser HMO Model - This pertains to your health insurance. Kaiser is good for basic/routine healthcare and has a decent level of experience with medical specialties. If you have a complex medical condition, the pool of available doctors that you can visit to help manage your care is very small so you are stuck with only 1 to 2 doctors. Getting a referral to seek a referral outside of the organization is impossible as I tried for years to get one and was constantly denied.Bureaucracy thy name is Kaiser - It takes forever to enact change in the organization. Kaiser is a ""collaborate first, make a decision second"" company. Getting approvals, making changes, pushing for immediate actions takes an eternity because so many people have to be involved with the decision making process and approve the changes.Very Top Heavy - As alluded to above, it is difficult to make rapid changes because of the top heavy nature of Kaiser - approvals for certain decisions can take weeks or longer as you have to engage with 4-6 levels of management to get agreement.Conflict Adverse - Kaiser Permanente does not like conflict and employees internally joke about it being a ""kumbaya"" organization. Dealing with differing view points and engaging in conflict management can yield great results. Kaiser pushes the most agreeable answer, which may not always be the best."|Become more agile, reduce bureaucracy, give employees more freedoms to make decisions.|4.0

Human resources|The current mangers respect my work, my time, and provide constructive feedback. I feel I am supported by management.|"The first time I came in contact with Kaiser recruitment was in 2011. I wanted to work at Kaiser because I found Kaiser philosophy and goals aligned with mine. I had the support of many Kaiser long term employees who were in clinical field and had come to know me through professional collaboration. Unfortunately, the recruiter who I still remember her name was resentful of me for no reason that I am aware of. I felt she ignored my clinical experience when she said ""experience has to be in this country"" . Now, where in any job announcement there is a mention of having experience on any particular country. She also dismissed the evaluation of clinical experts of me when she said "" why do they want to hire you"". She also had belittling tone of voice when she said "" you are probably just good for home health""For many years I did not apply to Kaiser anymore. I think HR needs overhaul in order to let people with clinical expertise at Kaiser have a say at who they should hire. I do not think Human Resources staff should filter applicants to clinical positions when they do not have the knowledge to evaluate applicants clinical acumen. Had my application been reviewed by clinicians at Kaiser in 2011i would have had a better chance of being hired then. The experience with this expert recruiter adversely affected my life."||4.0

Best pay, worst treatment|The pay and benefits were great. Time off was always granted if asked in a good amount of time. Most of the time there were hours that could be picked up in different departments to fill in the gaps.|I guess since they pay well, the management thinks they can treat you however. Personal life and work life balance sucked if you went full time and had an emergency. Personally I experienced the worst treatment by my Department Administration and supervisors because I was being beaten and mistreated by my husband at the time. They forced me out of my position after 11 years with the company, and illegally wrote me up while on medical leave after trying to commit suicide. Union is friends with management and didn’t like to step in to try and help. I lost everything and almost my life and they didn’t care. I was barred from getting a transfer and to this day I apply to positions and am told I don’t qualify for things that I do. This company is backwards. Workers cheat the system to get away with stealing company time. Employees that have worked there for years have what is known as Kaiseritis. They are lazy and do nothing. Management knows and let’s it continue. DAs are not well versed in the departments they run. If you don’t brown nose you won’t get hours. As a MA I found that 6 RNs we’re making medication errors on 1 patient and was targeted for any move I made because they were friends with some of the supervisors. It is ridiculous. It is all about who you know, not what you know there.|Take management courses and spruce up on skills. Friendship and work environment shouldn’t mix. When you have an employee in crisis give the same empathy you do to the patient. We are people too. A happy work environment make for more productivity. Prop up good employees and don’t let bad ones run the show.|1.0

Management|If you are in the right department,you'll have strong Leaders that care about you and your future. I find that new Leaders coming from the outside are the most interested.|Everyone wants to work for Kaiser and why not? They pay well and accept mediocrity. HR protects the employees, but not Leadeship. It appears they are more worried about being on the 100 best companies to work for so the employees drive that vote, not Leadership. So when push comes to shove between and employee and Leadership, bye Leader! Kaiser is more about making headlines like the new hospital, but if when you work there, you wonder how they win all these JD Power awards. Kaiser awards mediocrity hence why everyone wants to work for Kaiser. You can retire with a great 401k and skate through the day and collect a fat check bi-weekly all for doing the no minimum amount of work. Sense of urgency is not encouraged here. New Leaders coming in from the outside struggle with this practice. They want to make a difference and change the environment but quickly find, it's impossible unless the whole company enforces it. Until then, it's mediocrity at its finest.|"Advice to the CEO is stop accepting mediocrity and the term ""Kaiser two weeks"" exist for a reason . It means if you want something done today, it will be done in the ""Kaiser two weeks "" time. Back your Leadership! Just because employees have the voteof top 100 companies to work for, doesn't mean Leadership is an expendable asset. Leaders grow and develop people and the company."|3.0

Good job. Company vision lacking|Kaiser Permanente focuses a great deal on work life balance which allows for a stress free approach to working. The company also pays well, especially for the work load.|As a whole, the company is littered with corrupt relationships. Departmental funding is heavily influenced by who you know which leaves non-unionized employees frequently at risk. Additionally, this means that money for innovation usually goes into the wrong hands. On top of this, management is deeply rooted in the old ways of providing service. Piloting new, outside the box solutions, usually requires a great deal of effort and the end result is often a compromised product poised to fail. Another shortfall is their approach to promotional raises. They have a 10% cap on a raise from promotion to promotion. So if you go in cheap, just to get in, you will suffer in the long run. All in all, if you are looking for a job that pays well where you can settle in, this is the place for you. If you are looking for career growth, I would consider this company a pass.|"Take advantage of the talent you have. Stop outsourcing all of your work to 5 different companies. You will save a lot of money and you will boost employee moral as they will feel challenged and needed. Lastly, don't settle for satisfactory. The ""keeping the lights on"" mentality hurts the long term goal of reaching the stars."|3.0

Benefits are the perks...|I've been working for KP for 10 months now. It has always been my goal to work for KP 15-20 years before retirement because of the pension and medical benefits. The work environment is great and the people I work with including the MDs are all helpful especially during my first 90 days.|There are no standardized processes. Each MDs I work with had differing workflow. Now, being a case manager, this was quite challenging and frustrating for me. No one knew the policies and protocols and I had to navigate myself around what my predecessor was doing and the experience and knowledge I came with. I came from a setting where processes were vital to the success of my job. It was and still is for this KP job. Fortunately, I'm a driven person and am used to developing workflow processes that are within the bounds of policies and protocols. I was just surprised and disappointed that an organization such as KP has no standardized processes, protocols/policies for each of their departments.Another thing I've noticed is the training and orientation piece was not as comprehensive as what I'm used to- and management literally did not know how to help me. There was no formal training on how to use TORT, timeclock, clocking in and out, etc. .. I had to find out for myself or ask co-workers.|Improve new employee orientation and training process.|4.0

Cronyism & Favoritism In The Department|The benefits if I have to put something but it's not the best.|"Management in the department practices cronyism and favoritism. They preach one thing but practice another. They take care of Millennials even if they are completely incompetent and is dragging down everyone else in the department. If you're an older worker looking for growth, don't even work here because there's none herefor you. And if you're competent, they will dump all the work on you while going around touting themselves as the ""best performing department "" when in reality you have a few people doing all the work. You will only get a measly 2%salary increase and tiny bonus which do not even make up for the very long hours that you've already put in. On the other hand, those incompetent ones are generously rewarded. The very competent people are miserable and most have either left the company or are actively looking to get out. It is pathetic when you have colleagues telling you, that ""Management will keep dumping work on you because they know you can do the job . They will never give it to us because the know we will $$$$ up."" If working extremely long hours (weeknights and weekends) is what you like, then come to KP. Performance evaluations are done unfairly by inflating the ratings of the incompetent ones and management's 'friends. It's very obvious to see who got a good vs bad evaluation. And when you try to reason with management, they call you a troublemaker. If management finds you not in their favor because you challenge their incompetence , they will make your life miserable by writing false things in your evaluation or badmouthing you. It's basically career suicide in the company. .Overall, it's a very bad experience and morale is so low.Management will go out of their way to create career opportunities for their friends and not grow their talents because they are viewed as a threat. They will keep preaching that they are developing you just so that you stay working for them and doing all the work. This results in creating another group of incompetent leaders...It's a never ending cycle."|Executive leadership needs to see how dysfunctional department leaders are. To move KP to being a world class healthcare organization, then take care of the people who actually do the work, not those incompetent leaders sitting there and collecting big paychecks doing nothing but taking care of their friends or the lazy and incompetent Millennials just because that is what the CEO is pushing for. You will lose talents to your competitors because they are so fed up with giving all their best on the job but not being taken care of in return.Also don't promote the Speaking Up culture where employees are encouraged to speak up, but then reprimand them for speaking up, writing them up in their performance evaluation, and badmouthing them when they apply for a job in another department because that is the only person who carries most of the weight in the department. This type of leaders ought to be FIRED from KP because they create a very TOXIC environment.Please listen to employee compliance issues and do a better job of preventing retaliation! Do not punish those who report wrongdoing!|1.0

Great benefits, job security, but the usual bureaucracy|"Kaiser is a great place to work and build a career over time. In my experience salaries are above market for most positions, and the benefits are so good that many people become ""lifers"". The health coverage is extremely generous, and time off starts off adequate and gets better over time (18 days when you start, moving up to 33 after 15+ years - this does not include sick time). Employees truly believe in the mission of KP (at least, I do) and it's clear that this is a place where employees' contributions are valued. Although my role is not part of any of the unions, the fact that our workforce is predominantly unionized also places a positive role in KP's reputation as a good place for workers (although having unionized staff also presents many challenges). Overall, I enjoy working at KP and would recommend it to others, but understand that you are entering a big bureaucracy. A friendly, mission-driven bureaucracy, but still."|"Cons: having lots of ""lifers"" means that innovative ideas and workflows are not always adopted without a fight. People have their roles deeply embedded here, and any threat to the status quo is seen as negative, even though we need to make some pretty radical changes given the new health care environment post-ACA. There's a lot of ""not my job"" attitudes here. It's hard to navigate the layers of bureaucracy, both in terms of personnel/HR/benefits, and in getting work done (there are often 4-5 departments at the regional and national KP levels working on similar areas, and no guidance on who does what.) Be aware that KP is not immune to reorganizations and layoffs -- they do make a good attempt to ensure workers are hired elsewhere in the organization, but there are no guarantees, and there can be a lot of turnover in certain departments.Benefits are currently generous but are always subject to downgrades in the future, so just be aware of that. Some changes to the pension and retiree medical benefits are about to hit, and with them a wave of Baby Boomers will be taking retirement, which should hopefully open up many new management opportunities for Millennials.Oh, and the biggest con of all: we still - STILL - use Lotus Notes for email. Shocking, I know, but true."|Embrace technology, trust your employees, improve senior leadership communication with front-line staff.|4.0

What kind of loyalty is that for their employees?|Work on better managing the recruiting departments, consider training current RN's for specialty areas. Provide better benefits for non union employees.

Downey ICU RN|ICU director and pulmo are the BEST! if management would just stop harassing the nurses the unit runs it self. Doctors are very compassionate, caring, and genuinely always have the patients best interest. All are the best!!!|"In response to the ""lifers"" comment and push back with the Computerized charting or ""weekly"" changes...FAR FROM THE TRUTH as you did state that management is doing a lot of micromanaging, ""huddling"" in the morning any changes in 5mins then nurses have to sign a piece of paper that they were informed of the new charting expectations and at times with a specific time frame from start of shift. Furthermore, weekly expectations are always changing in ICU its expected for nurses to chart on ""real time"" and assistant directors are not ""directors"" they are the watch dogs, checking random charting and if nurse doesn't comply, with no regardless of how busy your assignment is or unit needs, the assistant director will call a union rep for you before the nurse even knows, and a ""conversation"" will take place. Union Reps are useless they always side with management. It's starts from the president J.E. of the union and it trickles down. I would advise any nurse going to KP system to really think if the salary/benefits outweighs a more conducive, cohesive and team work environment. The good old days of ""I love my job, I love kaiser"" is dead! Morale is at its lowest and personally I would give up a few dollars to be a happier nurse. The consensus for ATLEAST the past 5 years is go to ""work"" do your time and get out. ICU Downey RN attitude is go to work do ur job, make your money, stay low key and clock out at 1945. And hope you don't get called in the next time you go back to work for ""something"" you didn't comply with and hope union rep will assist you and not just go a long with management when he also doesn't comply with KP policy."||2.0

Unfortunately the managers hire and fire by word of mouth.

They took away a prior rule of lifetime medical after 15 years of service without notice. Most were told upon hire that was a benefit. They never said it could be taken away. BEWARE of any promised benefit, it can be discontinued at any year.They give you a outdated union contract that tells you they have progressive discipline , hire according to whose been there longest, post jobs internally, protect against harassment, and have a grievance setup. One mistake, big or small, & you may be suspended on first mistake. Jobs were not being given by seniority, some were not even advertised. They were hiring a lot of employees straight out of school. There is no designated trainer. I was called in by manager to tell me we want to get rid of zzzzz send me any information on her so we can fire her. Others have claimed this also.

Disappointed|Pay and benefits are terrific!|Management plays favorites at my location, taking DMA's candy to their desks and rewarding them for doing their job because she once was a DMA.|I was told if I wanted to be at Kaiser and tried my best that Kaiser would find a place for me to be. That wasn't my case. I was talked to right before my probation was to end and told that I needed to work on my chairside skills and that I had done a good job cutting back on the talking. My probation was then extended. I received a Skype message from my manager during dental assistant appreciation week telling me to keep doing what I'm doing and I'd get to keep my job past probation. Right before my extended probation was to end I was told by a different manager that my chairside skills had improved and were just fine but that my talking was too much. I asked with who (coworkers, patients, doctors) and it was never answered.Unfortunately, I can not better myself for my future if I don't know what to work on and I tried to make connections with people like my Kaiser training had taught us to do.|2.0

Dental is affordable but you have to use Kaiser dentists which you have to wait months to get seen. If you have a dental emergency, you're better off going out of network because you'll never get seen. Not a Magnet hospital. You have to stay within the Kaiser system and many of the providers don't have the time to provide good patient care due to the volume of patients.

Psychologist|Multidisciplinary staff are professional, well motivated, knowledgeable and highly skilled. This includes clerical staff, managers, cleaning crew, psychiatrists, social workers, MFTs and psychologists. Salary is better than most of the competition other than private practice. The benefits are good. If you do your job (and certainly most people do), you'll pretty much be left alone to work relatively independently. Psychologists may perform similar and/or identical functions as MFTs and social workers (intakes, group therapy, intakes, individual therapy, intakes, family therapy, and more intakes), or do a small amount of psychological testing, or even have their jobs defined as 100% psychological testing, something to investigate before signing up.|Kaiser Permanente Psychologists are highly valued in the San Diego area, even more so in Northern California, but not very much in the greater Los Angeles area. Psychologists earn a bit more salary than the other psychotherapists, the reason for the reluctance to hire more of them. The work load continues to increase for everyone. Just when we think it couldn't get any tougher, somehow it does. With union contracts, the negotiations can drag on for months or even years. The tug of war during negotiations can be very stressful. There have been strikes. The clinical team has been understaffed for many years. Staff often feel like they're on an assembly line. Staffing has never kept up with the increase in patient load. The quality of mental health treatment diminishes as the demands grow. Morale is poor. Psychiatrists, just like the other Kaiser physicians, become partners in the business after a few years. They too are terribly stressed, but as partners their motivation to fight for better care vs. keeping their eyes on the finances weakens. As partners, their jobs are protected to a ridiculous degree. Then again, union members have been known to keep their jobs, thanks to the union, when they should have been fired.|The clinical team works with middle management. Middle management is caught in the middle. They typically do what they can to make the system work, but they work with one hand tied behind their backs. They are under pressure to meet budgetary demands and the more they meet them, the greater their bonus. If they were to stand up to their superiors and demand better staffing so that the patients could get better care, they would be doing what ethics require of them, but they would also be putting their jobs at risk I believe. My advice: at least be honest with the clinical team (some are, some aren't). Additionally, some worry about getting into battles with the union, so they are reluctant to discipline clinicians and clerical staff who clearly and repeatedly break important rules.

Solution Consultant|Great culture if you don't get unlucky with the wrong boss, great benefits, great stability.|None really. Just remember, try to get another boss if it isn't working out with the one you have. HR is there to protect the company from getting sued and they don't care about fixing the problem.

Senior IT Project Manager|Promote and fund training. Could get a cheep MBA reimbursed by company. Some areas allow you to work from home. Large company so if no opportunity in your department you can still find opportunities in another department. Can request manager to review salary to assess for a pay adjustment. HR processes these requests annually.|Highly matrixed organization. Will take 6 months to understand all the systems, processes, who to engage and how to engage them for a simple project. Since projects can be multi-year and of different complexity, it could be 3 years before your familiar with all engagements if your functional manager is agreeable to exposing you to them. Projects take long since business and IT resources spread over so many projects that they move at snails pace. A lack of business accountability for projects add to schedule impact. Project managers are unaware of tools, processes, and updates coming their way until it is time for training. A lot of times training is scheduled during lunch. Work life balance is awful. It's normal to have seasons of back to back meetings 2 or 3 days a week without a lunch break. KP protects good and bad middle to upper managers.|Hire managers that have exposure to KP culture, know how challenging it is to deliver at KP, and want to make it great. Require functional managers to get so many resource training hours annually to continually development in their role. Prioritize projects. Whomever has decided that projects will not have focused attention continues to make KP slow to market. Resources could have been used to impact project manager and project team pain points. Instead, funding towards adding processes to slow project delivery. Would like it if options with less schedule impact, which are faster alternatives to current processes were considered. In spite of it all project managers persevere and deliver.|1.0

You can make a difference but it takes time|Kaiser employees are super mission-driven and focused on doing the right things for members and the communities the organization serves. The IT organization, where I worked, has a really tough job trying to drive innovation through a change resistant culture; they hire top notch talent who are rock stars in their prior industries. Compensation and retirement packages won't make you rich, but they are fair and will provide some security. Health care benefits are awesome.|"Driving change at KP is like trying to ride a bike through molasses. It takes an extraordinary amount of effort to change the way things are done and adopt modern innovations, partly because within health care, half baked processes can cause people great harm. However, KP's culture extends this conservatism and ""analysis paralysis"" into all of its business practices, not just clinical ones. To work here and make a difference, you have to be very patient, and figure out which execs have the organizational power to move your ideas forward, and then work through them. Some employees have been defeated by the inability to make progress, and there is somewhat of a free-rider problem in which a few employees take on most of the work while others do the minimum."|Move faster when you're considering an innovation that doesn't put patient care at risk.|4.0
Just when you thing you have the job of your dreams. Then they can take it away from you for no reason.|The only good reason to work for Kaiser is the Benefits and good pay.

The only reason I can think of is that the have this chip on there shoulder and protect by the Union that no can touch them. People can be rude very disrespectful to you especially if your a new employee. Don't ask question cause it can go against you. There very defensive if you ask questions about the Union and some Union Council are very pushy and aggressive on having you contribute more additional cost to there cause and programs even when you already are paying your Union dues. Managers are very rude and talk down on you.|Give the new employees a chance before you terminated them. Don't over hire people then terminated them soon after especially you knowing they left a past employment to work for Kaiser for better growth. Listen to your employees before you even judge a person and not giving the chance to show there work ethic skills. You hired them for reason especially when we have to go thru a invasive back ground check that takes about 2 months.

I have a non-clinical staff member who schedules patient visits for me. Their system allows my manager to track my performance and contribution towards HEDIS and Medicare metrics which is difficult for pharmacy in an internal medicine setting.|In my current role, I have limited opportunity to work with pharmacy students and residents. I would love to be a regular preceptor, but since there are so many pharmacists and so few students/residents my first opportunity is scheduled for 2 years after my hire date.|Consider enabling Kaiser pharmacists nationally through developing committee work groups and email chains so that pharmacists can share experience and ask for tips and ideas from peers.|5.0

HR - you guys need to do a performance review of all of your management staff if you want to keep your physicians and nurses happy and retain them in Kaiser.

Medical Assistant|Great pay, awesome benefits, several locations to choose from. You can transfer within the company. You can use all of your medical assistant skills. There is overtime available if you want it.|This place is hard work. It looks easy but, you are very busy multi-tasking all of your 8 hours. Some days you can hardly find a minute to use the restroom. Patients can show up late and Kaisers policy is to see the patient, so this can foul up your schedule right at the start of your day, cause you to be late for lunch as well as not get out at 5:00. The appointments are 15 minutes long and that isn't enough time for you to get vitals and input information in the computer and have the patient decide now is the time to use the restroom. Then have them undress appropriately. Let's not forget the exam, any tests to be ordered, and any follow up appointments. It is a daily grind!|Treat all how you would like to be treated, no favorites !Be fair and have compassion for your employees.No eye rolling, nasty looks, huffing as you walk away, or ignoring the employee.Do not have a condescending tone of voice.|5.0

Intense bureaucracy and politics but great mission and work/life balance|Work/life balance, possibility to work remotely, highly respected healthcare brand, dynamic external environment makes work interesting. The organization treats employees fairly and gives generous benefits.|There are so many layers of management that process is always more important than substance. Many Directors and VPs are excellent leaders and mentors. But there are too many and weak ones get by without contributing and successfully playing politics. The ratio of entrenched senior people to younger contributors and managers is unbalanced, making promotion opportunities few and far between. As a result the organization may face a shortage of talented younger workers.|Offer early retirement to 30-40% of your Directors and make room for young talent.

Great Benefits|I love the benefits. The health insurance is great, they have a pension, and generous PTO. YOu can tell Clinicians are very passionate about patient care.|Think its a place where there are a lot of people who stay and are complacent because of the great benefits, and decent pay. I don't feel a lot of career drive from folks. My perception also could be skewed given I am in a different generation than most of my peers. I also think there are a lot of managers who delegate so much work down to the little people. Its hard because I feel like I spend my day putting out fires they create either by not being clear with their expectations, or waiting until the last minute. While Kaiser is touted as being very diverse, I don't find that to be the case in the Portland office.|I know that I am here to make you look good, but its not fulfilling for me to do all of your work and you take all of the credit for it.|3.0

You get weekends / holidays / clinic closures off when working at the clinics and not the hospitals.|Negative work environment, leadership responds back with attitude when asking for guidance from them, fellow co worker and leadership gossip about other co workers. Training for new workers is horrible, not enough time in training new workers on scheduling how to book multiple departments, new workers get thrown in the pit of working alone after only 2 weeks of training due to high turnover. Workers feel undervalued and emotionally drained after each work day - Managment does not give enough tools or correct protcols in order for us to succeed in creating quality, patient centered healthcare.|Hire people who genuinely care to create quality, patient centered care with exceptional customer service. Don't hire out of favoritism or nepotism. Don't hire people who don't care about making everything they do at,work centered around quality, patient centered care.

Contact Center Supervisor|Starting Salary, Benefits, but honestly it's not really worth the extra money.|There is so much work that is expected of the Contact Center Supervisors, with little-to-no help from upper management. This position is also stuck between the eternal struggle of management and the Union. Management wants improvements, but is set to very rigid guidelines by the union contract. It is impossible to reward great employees because the union won't allow it, it believes that everyone should get a trophy. Meanwhile, they only protect employees who do everything they can to miss work or not perform when they are at work. There is no way to affect change because the Labor Management Partnership shoots down everything that might make the business run more effectively.|If you want to make employee engagement rise up,and if you don't want to lose supervisors every few months, start working to make a better business instead of protecting people who abuse the system.|1.0

REGISTERED NURSE 6 WEST LAMC|It was close to my house.|I had the worst experience working at this Kaiser location, Step Down 6West. If you are new employee they will give you the heaviest patients. If you try to complain they don't care. There was a charge nursethat thought she owned the unit. Unprofessional, rude, ignorant probably went to school in her home country, no manners whatsoever. I never experienced anything like that since I became a nurse, never had any problems at any jobs. That unit was a horrible place to work. No break room and we all know that 30 minutes lunch is not enough to go to the cafeteria which was at least 5 mins to get there. The manager of the unit is useless. I tried to let her know about the situation but she did not take a few minutes to discuss. They treat you as if you are not human. Kaiser Thrives...that's a joke. I worked there a short time and quit. I was getting sick, dehydrated. If they relieve you for a break or lunch don't expect them to cover your medication or do anything for your patients. I've had a full time job at another hospital for many years and tried Kaiser because it was close to my house but it was a huge mistake.

After all this time I am actually considering leaving because of this. People are not awarded positions based on knowledge and work ethic, which is pretty disappointing.|My advice would be to value your employees who work hard, are loyal and committed to the organization. Promote and award jobs with folks that have the necessary experience and expertise that is relevant to a position, not just because you know them. It is often not fair to the team.

Don't Start Your Career Here; Retire Here Instead|Kaiser is huge so each region/department is different. This review is mainly for the Bay Area regional/corporate offices (not the hospitals).Good work-life balance. Based on my experience, upper management actually cares about this. Many people avoid working more than 40 hours a week. Good health benefits. You are not challenged enough so you can coast through this place with mediocre salary... you don't have to be smart to excel in this company. People here are actually nice and genuine; most of the people care about the mission, which is great!Very stable company with great outlook. Their mission is wonderful and sometimes I feel proud to work for Kaiser.|Because this is a huge healthcare company, this company is prone to HIGH bureaucracy. Lots of legacy knowledge but barely any training for employees. Most of the the knowledge gained here is too Kaiser-specific; hard to bring the skills anywhere. Lots of hand-holding so if you're starting your career here, you may be wasting your time doing mindless, boring work while your peers at other companies are gaining more valuable experience. If you are not above manager level, expect to do mundane office work. You will also be stuck with people who are incompetent, resistant to change, and avoid taking any accountability. Not a great place to challenge and grow young/talented minds in the Bay Area. Therefore, I would advise people work here towards the end of your career but DO NOT start your career here.Because this is a non-profit, don't expect competitive salary (especially in the bay area) nor any type of perks. Depending on your department, perks are close to none, which lowers morale. After 5 years, there is pension... but that's a trade off. Either waste 5 years of your talent for pension... or go elsewhere for higher salary/fun perks and gain more valuable experience.|Try to encourage employees to challenge themselves. While we have done a great job giving back to our members, TRY TO INVEST IN YOUR EMPLOYEES. So many talentend young minds are leaving due to the high bureaucracy and mundane work.|2.0

Mission Driven Organization!|The Kaiser Mission of providing the member the best care at an affordable price is a very consistent and common driver amongst almost every single employee at Kaiser. The medical needs of the patient is the highest priority. Being an Integrated Healthcare provider (providing both medical services and insurance) works really well to ensure that patients receive the care they need. Highly intelligent group of individuals.|Can be very bureaucratic and overly complex as the organization has historically managed the multiple legal entities through a distributed regional administrative model that can have conflicting priorities that are not easily worked out. Different parts of the organization can have different interpretations of how to implement the KP Mission that can cause conflict. The further away the work of the employee is from the actual delivery of care in a region, it seems the more disconnected the employee is from what really needs to get done.|Continue with the One KP approach, but recognize that care delivery and administrative support at the regional level need to be better coordinated.|4.0
Beware of the two faces|Pay and benefits are great|"It's interesting how misogynistic some of the men working in this company can be.

I'm still constantly being told that I'm under qualified for the jobs I'm seeking to transfer to. Most of the time it is nepotism.

It is really hard to get work done in a quick manner.Office politics also add to this, and the insane layers of corporate bureaucracy just to approve a simple change.

No one is happy.-5-10 years ago, the benefits at Kaiser would have been great. Now they absolutely SUCK compared to most tech companies in the Bay Area.-Part of our job as Account Managers is to get ""FaceTime"" by meeting with clients and brokers, to take them to lunch and schmooze, etc...

Love working at KP in the I.T. Organization|Surrounded by smart co-workers, GREAT pay and benefits, and the focus on a work life balance including the option to work from home EVERY DAY has allowed for me to keep my sanity and morale up while on the job. My family is thrives because I work at KP. I've never been so productive and positive-minded working for any other company, as I have been at Kaiser Permanente in the I.T. office located in Colorado. I will mention also that all the various bosses I've worked for at KP in the past 9 years have always allowed me to direct my work and chose the way I'd like to get it done instead of micro-managing me. Clean, modern facilities and ample training/ tools to help one succeed at their job are more of the great perks offered. Honoring family time and allowing for PAID time off to volunteer for your community is another great perk (paid time does not come from your Vacation/ PTO allowance).|Can't really think of any. But if I had to nit-pick, I wish that KP would pay for tuition reimbursement for any college degree area that one would like to pursue, since college teaches you critical thinking skills regardless of the major and those learnings can be applied across many disciplines. But in this case KP will only reimburse the employee for those degrees or certificates that directly tie into your job.|"Continue the great work and please don't ever yank the learning curve safety net from under the employee. Allow for people to make mistakes and learn from them without humiliating them, docking them harshly on the evaluations or by targeting them for down-sizing (making them live in fear of being fired at any moment). I know you know this already, and that KP operates a very ""safe"" environment in this regard. Just reminding KP mgmt to never forget what you do WELL and please keep doing it!"|5.0

Strong Mission, Great Benefits, Employees Valued|It's a large, well-established organization, so very stable. Good pay rates and excellent benefits. They value work-life balance, which, for this mom, is a must. Lots of opportunities for growth and professional development here, and they have built a strong value system that reflects in the caliber of employees that work here. Management (at least the ones I deal with) are collaborative, seek out opinions of others, and encouraging.|"The flip side of working at this stable of an organization is the bureaucracy. Things take a long (very long) time to get done. Innovation is touted but in reality I wouldn't call this an ""early adopter"" type of culture. And the negative side to having such great benefits is that the benefits are so good that people never leave - which isn't inherently bad - but there is a firmly entrenched resistance to change, and getting people on board with a new idea can be frustratingly ineffective."|Encourage personnel movement within the organization as a way to fight complacency.|5.0
File Clerk-Medical Records|I worked as a File Clerk at Kaiser Permanente, and my overall experience there was a great learning experience.

I would have to say that when I worked in the morning shift in the File Clerk department, it was very fast paced, alot of pressure and the doctors were in a hurry alot and wanted a file so it was a totally different atmosphere than the evening shift.|I had really nice managers so I really feel like they both managed the department in a great way, so when you have nice managers to work with, that is an asset!|4.0

Inconsistent policies at middle management amongst departments."|"Encourage researching how other systems have successfully implemented the very systems that Kaiser says ""can't be done"". Encourage executive and senior management to embrace newcomers that have specific expertise.

Not progressive enough|*From my personal experience:You should choose to work at Kaiser Permanente if what you want is to work for a place where you can console yourself of your immense self-interest by claiming that what you truly want, above all, is to help others.|*From my personal experience:The culture of Kaiser Permanente seems to me torn between two eras of healthcare: One foot firmly in the past and another foot with a toe in the future. It seems that for all the lip service given to the idea of addressing inequities in access to healthcare and decreasing the cost of their health plan, there is a serious paucity in actual on-the-ground, community efforts to make a meaningful, measurable impact, specifically among underserved communities. Furthermore, there is a lot of internal wastage among the various departments, specifically with regard to money spent on meals for meetings. Often times, an absurd amount of food is purchased when only a handful of people end up showing up for the meeting. Later, the food is brought back to the department to share amongst the staff, and hardly anybody eats the leftovers, sending much of it to the garbage. Come on KP, there's millions starving around the planet. Another thing is that there is a great deal of stress among many KP employees who express their desire for additional staffing to help lighten their load and to help mitigate much of the extraordinary burdens faced most especially by employees in front-line positions. However, at the same time that Kaiser continues to keep recruitment at an insufficiently steady flow, they are actively constructing a medical school in none other than one of the priciest cities in America. I wonder how much of this project has to do with image. . . A completely closed HMO with its very own hospitals and clinics, and now finally a medical school, too. Sounds great. Additionally, if you're between 20-30 years old, you're going to be surprised by the sheer number of crusty people you will encounter who appear as if they got stuck in a time capsule from the 1990s, like the decades just passed them on by (their brains included). Kaiser still has a lot of work to do in terms of attracting the increasingly global- and progressive-minded millennials who will ultimately carry Kaiser Permanente into the latter half of the century, after the many centenarians retire (if they ever retire). It is true: It's sink or swim Kaiser. Although, secretly I do hope the next 25 years sees the devolution of the privatization of healthcare. Maybe it'll come in the form of an app that features single-payer care. Overall, Kaiser Permanente is a business at the end of the day, so the bottom line truly matters. Often times, the complex bureaucracy and numbers game leads you to forget that it is the alleviation of suffering and the improvement of the quality of life for human beings that is the core of your mission at the end of the day. What's more is that there is fierce resistance to change the status quo with Kaiser. Again, because there are so many older folks working for Kaiser, it is extremely difficult to garner the approval and support for progressive initiatives within the corporation. There is a great deal of ego clashing among stiletto strutting, Coach bag wielding power junkies alike, from appointment clerks all the way up to senior leadership. And, finally, this whole culture of 'physicians as God' B.S. needs to go. ASAP. Yes, that actually exists, and in orientation they literally make it apparent as daylight that there are two types of people who work for Kaiser: Physicians and employees. Wth? Get with the times, Kaiser, or you will surely fall. It isn't a natural right that you should experience boundless financial growth and success ceaselessly for all time.|Retire.|2.0

great compensation at the expense of low morale and no autonomy|wonderful compensation and benefits, in house CME|I have worked at Kaiser for 6 years, and am grateful for the excellent benefits and compensation - but it has come at a cost. The morale remains low and the turnover continues to be high - not only for my specialty (physicians across the board) but also for all nursing and administrative staff. There is significant churn at present in the management of the corporation as well. If you choose to work for Kaiser, please go into it knowing that you will need to give up all aspects of autonomy, and may find that you lose your passion for medicine over time.|to remember why we all chose medicine to begin with|2.0

Great place to work!!|Great communication between departments. Easier to coordinate patient care with Kaiser's care model. Excellent benefits and compensation. Yearly bonuses dependent on company performance with metrics. Fairly healthy work environment (though this will depend on what clinic you are working in).|Working in a union has its benefits (feeling like your position is protected and represented). The draw back: lazy or incompetent workers are also protected. If you are in Local 105 or Local 7 (hourly medical staff), overall you will enjoy the benefit of receiving annual increases from negotiations in California. However, if you are a hard worker with excellent work ethic, you will be annoyed by the slackers that are just 'putting in their time' and there is little you can do about it.|Continue to be open to creativity from your staff.

Your best ideas will come from those who are on the front lines!|4.0
Lots of miscommunication and gaps that I unfortunately fell through|Kaiser Permanante has great benefits and offers employees a lot of opportunities to develop themselves. While I was at KP I had the opportunity to attend multiple leadership development classes run by an internal consultant. I was not given these opportunities, I had to ask specifically for them. The office buildings are very nice and also have as much free coffee as you can drink (Peets). As an intern I was paid $18/hr with no approved overtime and no expense reimbursements. I received free health insurance for the duration of my internship.|Unfortunately during my internship I did not do much actual work and didn't end up contributing much to the collective effort. I interned in the System Solutions and Deployment department, which was described to me during my interview as a business support/development role for the electronic medical record system. In practice I spent the majority of my time at work sitting idle in my cubicle. When I had actual work to do, which was rarely, I was fixing billing errors. Going into my internship with KP I had two previous internships and four years of college (At a top-10 school) under my belt,. I was unable to use any of my previous experience or degree to help me, and instead spent most of my days copy+pasting data and clicking buttons in HealthConnect. I was not given access into the system until the fifth week of my ten week internship. During the first five weeks of my internship I sat at my desk and entertained myself on my work computer, doing nothing. When I finally got system access, I did about six days of button clicking and copy pasting in the remainder of my internship, and the rest of my time was spent surfing the web and sitting idle in my cube.I spoke with one of the higher ups in my department on my second to last day and walked him through my internship experience with KP. He was extremely disappointed in what went on, and said that things should not have happened that way. There were multiple times things could have been turned around for me and the other interns on my team, but they just weren't. Everyone on our team knew we were sitting around doing nothing, and our team lead knew as well. I also went over my qualifications and what went on in my interview, and he was unable to say why I was assigned to this department. (All the administrative interns are interviewed and then sent to a department that matches their qualifications). I learned from a coworker after speaking with this higher up that the intern coordinator was looking at other jobs and was very apathetic about the internship program this year.When all was said and done, I showed up at Kaiser Permanente ready to work. I turned down another job offer to work here and traveled all the way across the country to take this job because I thought it would be the best job for me. I had all my ducks in a row, but was placed in a department that was a very poor fit for me and ended up having a poor experience with KP. I don't think I will apply for a full time position after I graduate.Other Gripes:My work computer was not powerful enough to sort some lists I was sent and expected to sort in Excel.If you need anything done, you often have to call the HR service desk and spend a significant amount of time on hold. There was a running tally in my department and the record for longest hold time was almost two hours. I usually spent about ~20 minutes on hold every time I called HR.|Understand what is going on in your department at all levels, especially when it comes to people.

Management is a joke. Hypocrites left and right. Have to be willing to kiss operations/team managers behinds to get ahead. Very much like high school drama environment (with grown middle aged women and men). Micro managed down to the second. Need to go to the bathroom? Be careful, you'll have 3 managers waiting at your desk when you return asking where you were. Quality assurance is also a joke, most of them have never taken calls or are a million years old and are dumb as rocks. Pleasing them is impossible, you always have to take time out of your personal time to fight them and most reviews are denied. Extremely stressful. So stressful there are workers compensation and FMLA claims left and right. Super common for employees to experience GURD or stress induced irritable bowl syndrome. Not fun. Super high turn around rate. Retaliation is definitely a thing here. Even though they stress it shouldn't be. Having union on your side only helps slightly. Once you're on their bad side, they will literally try everything humanly possible to get rid of you. Overall the morals and beliefs of management, ops, and upper management are so messed up I would never reconsider working for this company again. I did it for way too long and the pay/benefits were no longer worth my happiness and mental stability.|Stop being hypocritical and micro managing every millisecond of a reps day. Stop playing favorites and pet reps. Act like adults, instead of teenagers. When a rep calls your line for help, answer the first time instead of continuing to gossip with the team manager or hpss standing at your desk. Operations needs a serious reality check. Being on the same side as your employees will not only raise moral but will also raise respect for you as an authority figure.

Why I'm leaving after 8 plus years|Good Benefits - 401k, competitive salary, ability to transition to different positions, education pay, 98 hours of sick time, vacation time commensurates with years worked, convenient locations if you need to move, union job|"I've been here for 8 years as an employee and 2 years as a intern. I have worked in both administration and clinic sides. I have dedicated much of my life to this company, I have sacrificed so much... including my health. My turning point was when a corrupt employee/ Chief steward and manager decided to try and fire me for my absences due to medical reasons. I have a debilitating medical illness that requires me to take off periodically. Kaiser is so staunch with the vacation and sick hours you've earned, that if you exhaust those because of any leave, you are immediately put in a spot and management will keep every tab and eyes on you. Leaves I was out on: medical: major surgery for my health (3 mos, 2012) medical: still birth; grieving (3 mos plus therapy; 2014) medical: work place injury (mental, 3 weeks, 2016).I am currently on leave, and have been thinking of resignation. The first leave was my own medical condition, but I had struggled to get my benefits settled and was constantly harassed by management for my time off. Second... I had experienced great stress from same manager plus another manager that I was hospitalized and I lost my baby due to preeclampsia. Third... stress at work, there are extenuating circumstances which I am not allowed to discussed, however when I first started this new position, the new manager had told an employee from another department that ""I better watch my lateness"". This is very unprofessional and uncouth. I ended up being ostracized for this as she has forced me to withdraw from people because of rumors she had spread. I reported to upper management for 3 months as I was so upset that I refused to go to work unless I reported to someone else. Furthermore, I had asked for adjustments to my work station, constantly because of my operation prior, and because I'm a Disabled person by CA state law. Though I repeatedly said this, management refused a desk high enough for me and a chair due to ""keeping costs down""the solution was to send THEIR ergonomic specialist to evaluate me, after repeatedly telling said person my needs due to my disabilities, i finally got the approval for a higher desk. Her first suggestion (and managers suggestion) was to stack reams of paper under my monitor to raise the height. Still to this day, I have no compatible desk and have 3 reams of paper under my monitor. No changes were made despite the approval of the ergonomist. I am right now being falsely accused and have had council with several upper management. They send a compliance representative to prove that You are guilty. I was shown a piece of paper with people called and was said that I didn't comply. This is all heresay, and even if I never did anything; unless I take this to court, I won't be able to save my job. This is a week after I was found on the floor of my office, face down and unresponsive. I've rescinded to getting out of this toxic environment, as no job is worth my health.The union has many rats and protects their most valuable people, however, if you are not of any value to them, they will do nothing to help. I was a steward and ended up being told on by a chief steward and was sent to talk to compliance about timecard fraud. I proved her wrong, and 2 employees/ union reps vouched for me.I told the area specialist about this, and he knew what was going on. No one voted her out and no one said anything when I quit."|Stop trying to spy on employees, talk and be present and respond and jump in. Your companys credo is Thrive.

Team Lead|The benefits of working at a prominent health care organization currently include, medical, dental, vision, and time off.|"Having lots of ""lifers"" means that innovative ideas and workflows are not always adopted without a fight. People have their roles deeply embedded here, and any threat to the status quo is seen as negative, even though we need to make some pretty radical changes given the new health care environment post-ACA. There's a lot of ""not my job"" attitudes here. It's extremely difficult, and at times impossible, to navigate the layers of bureaucracy, both in terms of personnel/HR/benefits, and in getting work done (there are often 4-5 departments at the regional and national KP levels working on similar areas, and no guidance on who does what). Be aware that KP is also not immune to high turn-over rates in certain departments, in addition to reorganizations and layoffs.Surprising, in their era of “affordability” they make everyone do more with less, which normally as a culture change is necessary for businesses to lean out and become more efficient. However, their process has, at times, handicapped them from actually supporting their mission of keeping the members first. Additionally, what’s most surprising is that while there are a lot of pending retirements stemming from corporate benefit changes in lieu of their affordability issues (read: decreasing employee benefits to help save money; people retire early to help save their own benefits from changing for the worse), they hire a significant number of employees from outside of the organization instead of training the employees that they already have and promoting them up through the ranks. This has significantly changed the culture of the organization for the worse, in my opinion, and is most evidently seen in the abrasion of the current crop of managers trying to “earn their stripes” on the backs of the front-line staff; driving them harder than ever before, decreasing employee satisfaction, and suffocating opportunities for professional growth and retention.Benefits are currently generous but are always subject to downgrades in the future, again due to “affordability issues.. Some changes to the pension and retiree medical benefits are about to hit, and with them a wave of Baby Boomers will be taking retirement."|Embrace technology, trust your employees, improve senior leadership communication with front-line staff, and promote from within.|3.0

Physician|Their benefits, but not worth the stress !|"This is a communist organization. I liked almost everything about my job as a hospitalist at Kaiser, except for their malignant leadership. It is a tradition in this company to promote either people who are very bad in their profession or people with mental problems in administrative roles. No one asks for your opinion, there is no democratic election process. Physicians who work in the front line are treated like garbage. Beware of the one who is still the chief of Hospital Medicine at SkyRidge. She has significant mental problems, she fires you if you dare voicing your opinions and she induces a lot of stress among her colleagues. If you have to pee while at work, she needs to know about it. She writes up her colleagues and she encourages the secretaries and the nurses to write up her colleagues, so that she can have ""a file"" on them and use it against them, when they are inconvenient.

IT at KP|Lots of interesting projects and growth, but KP moves slower than other organizations as it runs a bit more conservative and bureaucratic. This can be a benefit in shielding it from costly spending on a fad or trend that crashes, but sometimes means that the organization is slower in making some necessary shifts. Everyone is deeply invested in ensuring excellent patient care and in maximizing affordability to members and this does shape each decision made. Very 9.00 - 5.00 culture with the exception of the usual fire drills or heavy days leading up to a big project's debut or approval meeting. Strong compensation and benefits, and an East Bay vs. SF location.|If you're young, the pension isn't super attractive but is core to the total compensation package - you aren't eligible until 5 years, and most younger staff would prefer 401(k) matching. Sense that most feel they have to make upward moves across teams as many staff are very tenured (5 yrs +) in their role and it's difficult to move up within a team. Workforce is older (late 40s + 50s) and feels far more corporate than a tech company in the Bay Area. Working from home is possible but isn't encouraged. Very corporate structure makes onboarding and identifying the right office to help troubleshoot onerous - it took days to get a functional laptop and 3 hrs on the phone to get my mobile device working. Paperwork arrives from a variety of offices via mail, email and the online portal and it's confusing to identify what is and isn't necessary or complete. Tech is a bit out of date - mostly due to the necessary security precautions. Organization is finally phasing out Lotus/IBM Notes for email for Office 365/Outlook. Difficult or impossible to use some of the collaboration tools most younger workers are used to being able to leverage (Google docs/forms, Evernote, online project mgmt tools, etc).|Encourage a 'learning and development' culture where managers are rewarding for coaching and developing younger employees, and encouraged to promote from within to create more entry level vacancies to bring in the next generation of workers who will be critical in the years to come to advance and push forward the company's work.|4.0

Great culture. Huge bureaucracy.|Everyone I've met at Kaiser Permanente is really mission-driven, and truly wants to do right by our members and improve healthcare.

Great healthcare and retirement benefits.|"BUREAUCRACY. We are a large organization and to some extent this is inevitable, but I think a lot of the layers of bureaucracy could be eliminated. Doing this would make us more efficient as a business and would enhance our ability to innovate and scale up/spread those innovations.IT for healthcare providers seems decent (although I've heard more than a few complaints about HealthConnect). IT for any business function is terrible (intranet is bad, expense system is bad, travel system is bad, Lotus Notes is the bane of our existence.)HR tends not to know what they're talking about and it's very hard to track down HR policies when you have a question about something.No paid family leave, which I find to be both unethical and hypocritical for a healthcare organization (especially one that funds documentaries that say that lack of paid family leave is hurting our children!!)PTO is stingy compared to other places I've worked. Also, I don't like that there are not separate sick days. It incentives you to hoard PTO for vacation and work when you are sick, which is bad for everyone.There is a total lack of transparency on paths to promotion and salary ranges for each job level.Finally, Kaiser is an ""older"" organization in terms of mean employee age. Not a lot of Gen Y, many many Boomers."|If we truly want to deliver on our mission of affordability, we need to turn the lens on ourselves and learn how we can make processes, decision-making, spreading innovation more efficient.

Great resume booster... unfortunate culture.|KP has served me well as being a significant employer on my resume. I have learned many skills such as project management and health care delivery systems info. The benefits are great with very inexpensive health insurance, ample time off and the opportunity for a pension. Bonuses can happen but it depends on the overall performance of the company and your personal performance review.|In general, KP seems to promote external hiring than internal promotion. There is a 4% cap on promotional raises, which causes quite a few Senior Director level employees that have worked at the company for a long time to be vastly under compensated compared to someone that is hired externally. This salary cap and reward to external hires has caused a trend of current employees leaving and then coming back 2-3 years later so as to get a much higher salary than possible under promotional circumstances.Many of the departments are in 'silos', meaning if you require assistance for a project from another area... good luck to you. People in general are overworked and therefore protective of their time, however you are often not equipped with all of the skills necessary to complete projects on your own without some sort of cross-functional collaboration. Because of these departmental boundaries, projects can go on for months when they should really only take a few weeks.The onboarding process is terrible. There is no relaying of historical knowledge of whoever was previously in your position, making new hires have to start from scratch as far as all assigned projects and duties. There is no information regarding how to utilize certain services throughout the organization, and you are left to your own devices or pestering your fellow employees to figure out how to simply mail something or request extra software for your computer.|Fix the promotional pay increase issue and value current employees more through industry competitive salaries|3.0

Great Company..but..needs help staying with current technology|Great pay and benefits, if in the union, a lot of good options for career help advancement.|People in management never know what they're doing. They select the wrong people to lead a team. They need better employees that want to work together. Being part of the union allows those who don't want to care and contribute to the company stay and be in positions they shouldn't be in.|"My advice to the company.

National HR Manager|Kaiser Permanente has great retirement, pension and time-off benefits. KP has attracted some great employees with benefits, however, retention is becoming a problem. I stayed for over 10 years because of my amazing colleagues.|Kaiser Permanente has an extremely high turn over rate in National HR group. HR Business Partners tend to burn out in 6 - 12 months because of perpetual staffing crisis. Work life balance is impossible for the small team that is managing an alarmingly high number of high profile investigations and legal compliance risk issues. The salary is also below market and the stress of the work load is not worth it, even if salaries increase. Most HR employees don't use the time-off they accrue, since always in staffing crisis.|Provide infrastructure and staffing to better support HR teams to address high-volume of issues.

Stodgy, Well Intentioned, and a Bit Toxic|I worked in the marketing department, not one of the hospitals. Good attention was paid to diversity of every kind -- they were determinedly inclusive of race, creed, gender, and orientation, and that is a wonderful plus in any job. I also worked with some dedicated, talented, wonderful colleagues.|At one time, Kaiser was extremely steady work. Then they panicked during the recession and started solving all their problems with waves of layoffs. And then they panicked again with the passing of the Affordable Care Act. To lay off so many good people and still feel about yourself, you have to de-value your staff and contractors as human beings, and that is exactly what upper management did. Upper management weigh in on aspects of projects that are completely outside their skill set, the expertise of longtime staffers is completely discounted, and everyone pretends the company's dedication to work-life balance is real as you get pushed to spend crazy-long hours to make your deadline because some VP took an extra week to dither over a project they didn't know enough to evaluate in the first place. And all of this has to be done while pretending you're a happy happy happy Kaiser drone and nothing is ever wrong. It's a deeply toxic culture and watching upper management deal with each other is like watching the Borgias. Not that they want to solve this -- they know that when you feel like you could get fired at any minute, you'll suck up bad treatment and work harder. You'll work with some terrific people at your own level. Just be prepared to talk endlessly about creativity and innovation while any actual effort at originality is strangled by eternal meetings and review rounds.|Learn to appreciate your employees as skilled, trained, knowledgeable people. Learn to value your employees as human beings. Maybe let go of the rah-rah-happy-happy patina that has to go over everything and actually fix the toxic culture.|3.0

Great aspirations but slow moving|KP is very mission-driven. And it's a place that lets many people interpret its mission in their own way, which is good in that many people can align their passions with the organization's mission. There are lots and lots of outstanding, talented people at every level of the organization, and amazing resources.|The down side of letting people interpret the mission in their own way is that there is frequently lack of alignment on the core work to be done, and the organization tends to be very, very process-heavy in trying to get everyone aligned and working toward the same objectives. And these in turn makes KP less than nimble -- much less -- and often means that good ideas and good projects are left only half-implemented.|Finish getting the organizational decision making streamlined and strengthened.

Some of the people I worked with were wonderful, some not so much--it's a huge company, so that makes sense. Tons of diversity.|Pay is not great--but again, the work isn't that hard. In my experience, once you're locked into a salary, hard to make a jump beyond the basic yearly 1-3% raise--even if your work/title changes to support an increase it's hard to get big jumps. They also used to like to say the reason they pay low is because the benefits you get are considered 50% of your salary, which we all know is a major stretch.|Some managers are really fair and support their people, others are all about playing the management game, which is not stacked in the favor of the employees. Depends on the department/manager. The advice I have for those managers of the latter category is don't tell your employees you're for them when your actions consistently prove otherwise. They see it and resentment/toxicity on the teams can build quickly, which in the end hurts you, too. You're better off saying less bout it than lying or playing games. The great hope is that as a manager you actually become FOR the people who work for you-then everyone wins!|3.0

Good pay, bad management|Good pay, that's about it|I was an on- call MA for a Peds office and it was not the type of management I was looking for. Originally during my interview I was told I had to work 80% of call ins to comply with my job. I started working and they literally wanted me to work everyday including weekends. I was only willing to work 2-3 days a week so I declined the other days. During my reviews (since I was still in my probation period) I was told I need to pick up more shifts since I am required to work 80% of shifts offered to me... They wanted me to be a robot and work everyday! I was also having some health issues that were mentioned to management and they just didn't care and just wanted me to be at work and not call in sick. At the end of my probation period, I was let go since I wasn't complying with their requirements. Honestly, I am so happy that happened.Another great big con is that they have so many different systems they use for everything, meaning you need a different password for everything. You also are not required to change any passwords, which is crazy because they are responsible for protecting patients privacy! That means the systems can be hacked more easily than others!Another thing is that management is way more leanient to their employees in regards to fake nails, facial piercings, tattoos (that don't look professional. Some should be covered up), and even tongue piercings. None of which should be allowed when you are working directly with patients. It seems like they don't care about their appearance being professional.Seniority is a great big deal since that's what they use for everything, time off, holiday work, etc. kaiser is not so friendly with giving their employees time off for family events.|Stop focusing in making soooo much money and focus more on your employees and their needs.|2.0

Emphasis on doing more and more work with fewer people and resources. Overtime for hourly employees is not paid or permitted, even though the size of workloads and time critical nature of much of the work often requires working overtime. Many internal services not related to patient care are unnecessarily complicated & ineffective, yet efforts to improve them seem to fall on deaf ears.|The senior staff assistants have just recently been organized into a union, which is currently in bargaining with Kaiser. Although as a rule, Kaiser strives to have cooperative, positive relationships with its unions, there is a certain amount of unease in management circles about this new development. As senior staff assistant positions become open, they are being re-catagorized into other groups so that -- even if the responsibilities remain essentially the same -- the position is no longer a union position. This creates a uneasy climate for future relations between the unionized Senior Staff Assistants and Kaiser which needs to be openly addressed, and so far -- Kaiser hasn't made any public statements of acknowledging the new union, or expressing a desire to work together.|4.0

It's an everyday reminder that there's always a social impact to the work the organization does, which is kinda satisfying.Consensus-driven: You'll most likely see lots of collaboration between teams and departments in the work that you do. It's great because you get to see an integrated response to a business problem. Also, having teams collaborate to achieve a shared goal helps the organization limit people working in silos, which is certainly possible in an organization of this size. Old timers have also commented that the consensus-driven approach means that there's shared accountability for any poor decisions, so that no single team is necessarily thrown under the bus.Smart Colleagues: For all of you that care about prestige, you should (not always true but, more than likely) find some of the brightest people in the industry working as your colleagues.Great Benefits, Fair Pay: A lot of other reviews talk about these two so I'm not going to repeat that here.|(relatively) Long Hiring Process: Haven't personally experienced this but, I've heard multiple accounts of the hiring process taking 30+ days even for initial phone interviews.Consensus-driven: A downside to the aforementioned positives of being a consensus-driven organization is that things move slow(er) at Kaiser, compared to other companies. If you're all about rapid decision-making then this pace will frustrate you. On the flip side, because decisions aren't made rapid-fire, the organization makes fewer stupid mistakes.|- Stay mission-driven.- Continue to find ways to engage your younger workforce in the organization.- Continue providing training and development to your workforce.|4.0

Great Benefits and People. Leadership treats Exempt Poorly|Company allows quite a bit of autonomy (telecommuting) if you've earned it. Quite a bit of opportunity to move around IF you are a high-performer. Many people who work for KP are very driven, mission-oriented people which makes group-based collaboration almost functional (a tall compliment). Many of the high dollar benefits are downstreamed to retirement which increases KP's stickiness. Healthcare is 80% employer paid. Vacation accrual is fantastic for 10+ people (6 weeks). People tend to stay a long time at KP if you've been with KP for more than 5 years.|"The company is definitely infected with politically correct controls on speaking freely and directly. The exempt employees have been used as a bargaining chip (no raises above 2% for YEARS) against the highly compensated collective bargaining units to convince them lower their demands. The company does not link performance reviews with merit increases, which is very annoying.

Good company, good values, turbulent market|In many ways, KP strives to deliver on its mission. I believe the organization is working hard to improve the health of its members and the communities it serves. Leaders want to improve quality for all patients and eliminate health disparities. The community benefit work is not put on for show - it's driven by passionate people who genuinely care and want to change the world.|Depending on which group you're in, KP can be a great, collaborative, and engaging experience or it can be a mess of fiefdoms, infighting, indecision, and pettiness.My experience has mostly been positive. Or I've just adjusted to the pains of working in such a large organization, knowing that the benefits remain worthwhile. And by benefits, I mainly mean the people. Money, vacation and pensions are part of the equation, but if you don't like the people then hardly anything else matters.The main pressure the organization currently faces comes from adapting to health care reform. It's not easy for any health care organization to adjust to wild fluctuations in membership, address operational needs that come with membership changes, and the imperative to keep costs low.|If you're going to continue saying that people are the organization's greatest asset, please make an effort to treat them like that. And if we're committed to promoting the Thrive lifestyle in our branding and marketing, please encourage employees to fit healthy living into their busy work days. Make it easier for them. We pay attention and we notice when there's alignment on this, and when there's a disconnect.|4.0

It's one of the primary reasons I left. I now work in a non-labor company and the staff are FAR more engaged and own a much greater share of the accountability in the business because we're free to make it happen as it should. Such a shame that Kaiser is so restricted by what they've built. It is positively immobilizing and, in my opinion, will be a major nail in their eventual coffin."|Renegotiate the LMP.

Great job security, lots of bureaucracy|I need to clarify that this review is for the health insurance side of KP. Benefits and salary are very decent for the amount of work expected from a typical employee. There are many people who have worked at KP for almost their entire careers. It is a good place to develop skills you already have or if you want a stable, low stress, long-term job.|Because the benefits are so cushy and because it is nearly impossible to be fired at KP, there is a lot of dead weight. KP is very bureaucratic and getting things done depends on your connections, which favors the lifers. There is very little incentive to innovate. Many talented employees have left KP because it is difficult to move up the ladder or because they are frustrated with the lack of innovation. Very recently KP has tried to address these issues. I hope that their new policies improve the work environment.||3.0

However, once I continued my HR career at other companies did I realize I was making 50% less than what I should have after 10 years of experience. Pay is low and stress is high. I appreciate the intent and support of union, however both labor and management make it difficult for everyone around them due to their disagreement on bargaining agreements and company policy.

If you are interested in working on bringing very large IT projects to fruition very quickly and using technology to improve healthcare, there is lots to be excited about working at KP.|KP is moving in the direction of forcing all its employees to use its healthcare, which is great if you are young and healthy, but the quality of care has been going down as cost pressures due to Obamacare continue to rise. My family had a bad experience when one of us came down with a relatively exotic and poorly understood disease, and KP completely botched the diagnosis and care of it, and once it was realized they did not have the ability to treat it. refused to refer us out to a doctor who could help us. We ended up having to change healthcare plans to the PPO plan in order to get care. Now they are eliminating that with no alternatives other than KP healthcare. I am afraid I will have to leave the company to get the medical benefits my family needs.|If you want to attract and retain the best talent at KP. you need to keep the benefit options flexible and continue to offer a PPO or at least a subsidy to go out to an exchange and buy a plan.|3.0

Its not uncommon for them to fast track marginally competent managers. With work environments like those at KP accountability is rarely emphasized, especially at the highest levels, but also among the ranks of senior directors and vice presidents--of which there are literally thousands.

Its not because of pay its because of mastery(education), autonomy, and purpose(why you want nurses to do things a specific way) this give you better buy in.

Company is focused on healthcare directives and does a good job of promoting the culture of excellent patient care. Most employees are good workers, and in most areas the management staff is more than capable. It's an overall good work environment with decent pay and excellent benefits.|No succession planning whatsoever. Skilled employees leave or retire and leadership drags their feet deciding whether or not to replace them. More often than not, the work is absorbed by the remaining staff which leads to poor morale and no work/life balance. Favoritism runs rampant at some levels, which makes upward mobility a challenge. If you have a senior leader in your corner, you may have a better chance of promoting up. Technology is below par, but I think they finally are trying to move forward with more 21st century tools and resources.|You need to create a talent management and succession plan that is fair and capitalizes on the vast amount of skilled professional employees under your own roof.|4.0

Prescription for Insanity|"The best thing about the company is the pay and the benefits. Many employees have compared the company and what comes with it as the ""golden handcuffs"". If you want to work then you will find the technology to be rather user friendly. You may meet some really great people along the way."|"The majority of the employees are part-time status but forced to work 40 hours a week. Almost 13 years with this company and minimal opportunities to have consistency with scheduling.This company is losing it's values. It reminds me of how a little hole in the wall burger place had the best tasting, best quality, affordable authentic menu until they expanded. Before, the staff of the smaller establishment was like a family, they took care of each other. As the company grew they lost site of what made them great in the first place. The food became ordinary and sloppy and the new workforce got treated like an expendable piece of trash. Kaiser refuses to take responsibility for it's upper management. The management has become like a mafia out to play God over your life. They are ego maniacs and cruel people.They have been given so much rope that they know they can harrass you, bully you, discriminate against you, and get away with it and if you don't grovel for their mercy, they can take an honest living away from you and your family. As I type this review I'm getting knots in my stomach, it is that disheartening. This is a healthcare organization that will reprimand you for being unhealthy or having health challenges. Many people may be saying, ""that's what the union is for"" and I reply, ""what union""? Let's be clear, you can't work for this company in some departments without be apart of the ""union"". Well my experience with the union has not been positive. Your union rep. will be the 1 and only union rep for about 31 different sites. So just think, your 1 location may have 30 employees alone represented by this rep. whom I must say is human and grows weary. Sometimes you might find yourself in some turmoil with management and need urgency only to find that the problem had enough time to snooze with no assitance from labor to make you just give up on the issue for the moment. Unfortunately, you will feel desperate enough to reach out to your rep. again because once there is a discrepancy with management, that my friend is how you land yourself on the hit list. You will be scheduled the most undesireable job duties, if you don't have a set schedule you will be dished the most undesireable schedule,and things that can slide with other employees you will be written up for. You can go from having level 0 write-ups to having level 4 in a matter of months which means you are almost unemployed. They claim to have a lot of things in place to deter and report this type of behavior such as compliance, no retaliation policies and HR but it is all an illusion too. HR will always favor management, compliance will want some type of identifying information so you can really be retaliated against although supposedly you can report things annonymously, and retaliation can be masked by management with things like their discretion and the needs of the department. The nepotism may be a contributing factor as well. You may go to your manager's supervisor as the chain of command states to with an issue only to find out they were room mates in college, or they were neighbors somewhere. You will carry a stress that is beyond belief unless you can become apart of the favorite clique. Yes, I said clique as in high school, mean girls club; that kind of thing at work. If you don't you'll find yourself in a living hell. None of your stress will be simply from what you were hired to do. It will be the bureaucracy that exist."|There is a reason for guidelines and procedures. Following the order of seniority where it applies, and steering clear of immature practices influenced by your favorite group of people is the managerial thing to do. You've accepted the position, so execute it with it integrity. Manage your entire staff in a fair and just manner, not just the people you want to make an example out of by abusing your power by sticking it to them every chance you get. We spend more time at work then we do physically caring for our loved ones and though it comes with the territory, some of us would prefer to do the job that we're hired to do and be excluded from the cruel games that you choose to play with peoples lives. Use your power to be an example of greatness and touch lives in a positive manner, stop using your power to abuse staff.|1.0

Plastic Surgery Department intern|Kaiser really cares for their interns and really try to make it a great experience. Being a high school student I anticipated clerical duties, but overall the nurses and the doctors in my department really tried to teach me. From taking to vitals to making sterile trays to even shadowing the head surgeon in operation, it was really a tremendously informative experience. There were days where there were no patients, and as a result I wound up not doing much. However they offered to let me go over to general surgery or to just sit and talk with the nurses when they weren't busy.|Some friends in other departments said they didn't do too much, but my department was consistent in providing things for me to do.||4.0

Micromanage and bully them, and they feel unmotivated and just do the job necessary to get through the day. And pick better people for management, ones that encourage their employees instead of the ones that think disciplining at all times is a way to make things better. Respect is earned and when you have supervisors lying to their employees and trying to scare the respect from them, it doesn't work. We can't respect supervisors we don't trust.|1.0

Average work place for IT|"Laudable mission - I feel that KP truly wants to make affordable, high quality healthcare accessible to all. Overall KP has a good integrated care model that can transform care delivery if they are able to adapt and survive the changing marketplace.Good benefits, actually offers a pension plan if one survives past 5 years here, good PTO, decent work life balance, flexible telecommute, mobile worker options.Potentially decent learning opportunities in healthcare (if you are non-technical) since KP offers care delivery as well as manages insurance plans, which is unique.Good values - eco friendly (go green), emphasis on employees being healthy ""thriving"" etc."|"Lot of bureaucracy, process heavy, complex organization to get anything done (lot of overhead, layers, archaic processes that tend to block work).Compensation is average, with flat to very little raises in recent years. In some groups in IT, people do have to work quite a bit and they will probably make outside in the wider IT industry (outside healthcare). There are several competent folks here working in the trenches who could get hired elsewhere (the attrition has been quite high in the last year).Little to no recognition for domain experts (e.g. a technical expert would have little value here with pretty much no career path). Career mobility is non existent for the most part.Most of upper management don't have seem to have domain knowledge in IT areas they manage especially when it comes to technical areas, focus is often to keep variance to budgets in control (when the budgets themselves are quite often a line in the sand).Probably not a good place to join in IT if you are in California with cost cutting moves on - may want to stay away if you are in California... but if you are in Georgia, might be a good option to consider. KP plans to hire for IT heavily in Atlanta in the coming years.Medical groups here probably tend to call the shots and seem to control the company and don't seem to want to compromise when the rest of the company is trying to cut costs to make healthcare more affordable. The whole interaction of the ""for profit"" medical groups working as part of a non-profit healthcare organization seems murky.Increased outsourcing makes for an uncertain future in IT, it may turn out ok if KP grows sufficiently, else there will be the inevitable cuts. This is probably not unique to KP though and in general true for all healthcare companies, given the dynamic marketplace which is forcing change at a pace never seen before in healthcare."|"This is focused on IT and may not apply to the rest of KP...Hire management that understands domain areas well instead of people who can just upward manage. Many of the current directors and above are ""people"" managers who can't inspire the rank and file in general (there are always exceptions of course).The current structure and culture at KP is not conducive to innovation, it will probably ensure innovation in healthcare happens outside KP. The marketplace will force change quickly and KP isn't setup to handle it in most cases. Perhaps that is the right model, let the marketplace innovate and KP reacts to the demands. In most industries large firms react rather than be the bearer of change and perhaps KP is no different. A smaller healthcare organization (such as Mount Sinai or a Mayo Clinic) or a startup like Oscar will possibly show how to get something done and perhaps KP can then adopt it (be forced to change). Of course the risk is lasting long enough to make the change without going under. With all the consolidation on among insurance carriers, its feasible a large insurance carrier (or a small one like Oscar!) will team up with nimble care delivery organizations (hospitals, clinics) to perhaps do a better job at care transformation..."|3.0

If you are used to high tech, you will be astounded at how you have to get into the 'who will clean the coffee pot"" today--which ends up being something the women do."|"They offered me a position they said was a contract to hire type job. I left a great contracting position because what they offered was closer to home and I was juggling a special school situation with my child--which I was not allowed to let them in on as I was with a head hunter agency. Another weird issue --you had all these insane rules about contacting the manager about anything relating to your work situation. . . and you couldn't email out. It was RIDICULOUS. . I was supposed to be at a location with a great commute to my home, but they said I'd have to be at a location another hour a way ""for a while."" Despite this change and the fact that I'd quit the other contract to get this, they offered no flexibility in the new place, and the same starting time, and scoffed at my complaints about the traffic on 680 when I would get there late--unavoidable as I had taken the job being told it was the close location around the corner from his school but the other was a 25 mile commute down crazy 680 and 580 in the worst rush hour times. And I couldn't drop him off early. No that part is not their fault I had to deal with my son's school drop off (special school so no bus possibilities) but it IS their fault that the job I agreed to was in place one and they moved it to place two but refused to change the start time or accommodate the craziness even temporarily while I worked it out or found someone who could get him dropped off. EVEN THOUGH I could have done the whole job as a telecommute or some of it--only one team member was even there! To make a long story short, I was trapped. I couldn't get them to move the time it started to avoid traffic or to accommodate dropping off my son off at a better time, or even to give me the time to arrange some other situation for him. But still they insisted I start at exactly 8:30 in the midst of a terrible traffic situation, and leave at 5:00 even though, again, my management was never there, the people I served were remote, and there was only one other coworker ---who hid in his office down the hall all day. So they basically changed a 15 minute twice a day commute into a 2 hour twice a day commute and as I said scoffed at my begging them to let me work in the other location, and scoffed that traffic could be that bad (the manager who scoffed lived in another state and did not believe my reports that traffic had doubled from 2009 to 2013. But it had. ANyhow that was bad enough. The rest was they changed the nature of the work they wanted me to do and again, I had left another job to get this new type of work for me. The kicker was that while I was there they decided not to hire any IT people from Northern California. So the contract to hire I had been enduring all this for --the prize at the end of the rainbow- was bogus. Then, they let ME go with no warning no severance of course, no chance to explain what I had accomplished (including training an intern) and no apologies. It was one of the worst jobs of my life, and it set my career back several years as I could have stayed at the previous contract at a wonderful company but had left for the chance of a perm job. ARGH.The two locations I am speaking of are Pleasanton and Walnut Creek. I couldn't list both below."|For God's sake admit you screwed up outsourcing IT to that other company. Get it back, get over it. It wasn't your fault that this mistaken direction happened. But it was your fault that you continue to not want to correct it. Or something. I don't get it. Please just hire someone to keep the kitchens up and do the coffee. This is just the norm in high tech and if you don't do it some women --even high level ones--end up doing it and get very resentful and can't wait to leave. Yes, it should be equitable. But it is not.|1.0

I think her mind was on vacation before she left. She forgot to tell me and the other new hire that we were supposed to do certain computer training programs before we took the electronic medical records class. Pretty much the same thing happened a week later. The new hire and I were supposed to do something the day before a certain class and we found out mere hours about it before the day before the class was to take place, which wasn't enough time for me to get it done. The excuse for the first time was that they ""didn't know"". How didn't you know? Is there no communication?I had to do the training program after the class, but I doubt it would have helped because it was hours of someone speaking in monotone and the program saying, ""For this demonstration, we have done it for you."" Really? Because people can't figure out how to click on something that's highlighted or type a few words?I was told I ""wasn't being attentive enough"" because training consisted of watching someone do their job for hours at a time, which isn't how most people learn. I explained that, like most people, I was a hands on learner and I wouldn't have my questions until I tried to do the job for myself.My trainer was rude and sarcastic and her behavior was excused by management because, ""the department is in upheaval"". They ""tried"" putting me with someone else, but that lasted for all of two hours because my trainer decided to have me shadow her again. She hated my guts and she got to decide just about every aspect of my training. Isn't that a conflict of interest???Heaven forbid I made an understandable mistake (if you're a reasonable human being that is) and I got grief for it. Excuse me, but isn't the training period supposed to be when people make their mistakes? I got griped at for not knowing something and I was told I should have known it because it was ""covered during class"" and I wasn't believed until the other new hire said that it wasn't covered during class.So, because they ""don't have the manpower"" to train me with more hands-on learning, that was it.The fill-in manager was the one do to it.

Assistant Manager/Assistant Department Administrator (ADA)|The Position: I have been a nurse for three decades.

The reason why I took the position was because of the people I would be working with, not the position/job title.IT: When I call IT for issues, they are very helpful; As long as the issue is not an access issue.|IT: The IT on-boarding program requires an overhaul!!! It took me two months to gain access to most of the programs I needed to do my work. It seemed as though each individual program/access needed to be requested separately from my director. This delayed my ability to do my job effectively and timely. After three months, I am still having to ask for access for a few programs. In sum, I expected Kaiser to be well organized. However, there is too much sub-contracting in the IT department, and there is not one access request for managers. Instead, each access is requested separately and this delayed my on-boarding, decreased my effectiveness, and added ALOT of frustration for me , the staff I managed, and my director.Staff: The staff who have been at Kaiser for a long period of time do not know what the standards of care are and what the productivity level is at other facilities. In many ways, the standards of care and productivity is higher at other non-Kaiser facilities.Continuing Education Travesty: The number of certified staff in our specialty is significantly lower than the facility I came from. Over half of the staff were interested in attaining certification. However, when a certification study group was organized, the staff not interested in certification made it difficult and verbally and non-verbally harassed/ridiculed the staff who were interested in attaining their certification. As a result, no one is attaining certification in our specialty.Hours: I am a salaried employee.

(KP.Walk ect)|Fairly new Exec has created chaos with top down management style, trying to turn our great NW region into a California KP (Fast food medicin). Management does not respect the Union's and openly circumvent contractual agreements. Seasoned employees that are incompetent whose work loads are carried by newer nurses and staff. Admin's (Very young) with MBA's make foolish decisions without consideration of the human effect. Lastly there is a new edict to make all staff in the NW move to 5-8 hour shifts.|Medical facilities should remember that medical staff are human, grant us the respect that we earned when we survived the training! Allow autonomy and trust until demonstrated failures occur.

My experience at Kaiser Permanente|Kaiser Permanente provides employee better than average health care benefits for a reasonable co-pay. The medical facilities are some of the best in the country. Many positions in IT are telecommute positions to avoid the traffic in metropolitan areas.|In the past, Kaiser IT was proud to advertise about promoting from within, but now it is very rare. Each time a new CIO or senior manager is hired a completely new philosophy is introduced without any regard to the company culture or what is currently successfully working. And the upper management turnover in IT is high. Offshore employees have displaced many of the IT personnel with no end in sight.|Return to promoting from within. This will motivate employees to work harder because the is something to try and achieve. Help displaced employees find another position in the company when replaced by off-shore workers.|3.0

Good Company with amazing history and vision|Benefits are great. Pay is good in this area for nursing. I think that Kaiser has the best intentions for their members. Some departments give nurses a lot of autonomy.|"It can be very difficult to be the worker bee in a Labor Management Partnership. Despite having union bargaining (and dues), when you fall through the cracks it is really hard to get the back-up you'd expect from your union. And seniority can really put a strain on the relationship you have with your coworkers.Bargaining agreements have pre-nogotiated your pay scale and raises, so many staff know they can get away with just doing the minimum requirements to get by, it makes it hard to get people involved with committees and staff lead initiatives which I think are essential for well run departments.Unfortunately, with this region being outpatient clinics only, most RNs are stuck on the phone lines due to triage requirements. Also, the company is so large with so many people doing so many different things, when you try to get a patient hooked up with the right resources it seems like the different departments play a game of ""not it"" and try to pass the buck! Accountability and integrity can be an issue in those instances.Lastly, Epic is an amazing EMR system with HUGE potential, but for some reason - in my region - they don't use it to its potential; they develop tons of workarounds instead of using the built in functionalities."|Please support your team! Some managers are great at embracing the extra effort their staff put into their work, others are not supportive at all. This is the first time in my nursing career I've had to work on my committee responsibilities at home on my own time. And those employees that want to do extra, let them, there's probably a lot of tasks you do that can be handled by them and they will feel good being able to help.|3.0

You'll be waiting forever because like I said, the employees that have been here want it all. They get to choose their vacation first.

Pay is excellant, however, if you work day shift, you will never get a 1 week vacation working the day shift.|1. Pay is great2. coworkers are all friendly3. great benefits (minus vacations that are all denied)4. Union has potential to help, but contract is never followed or enforced.|1. Have not been approved a 1 week vacation for last 7 years. You get denied all vacations, and then you are told you cannot accrue anymore vacation if you have 500 hours banked. They say you must use up vacation days in order to accrue more if you have 500 hours banked, but they deny all vacation requests. you can take off a wed here and a Thursday there, but denied all 1 consecutive weeks off. They do not utilize Per Diem staff to approve vacations. You request your vacations once a year by seniority. So if you want to plan a trip to Hawaii or similar, you are denied because more senor people take all vacation days. Union contract states they must back fill in order to let employees use accrued vacations, but Unions do not enforce their contract and they refuse all grievances, (seiu)they claim they strive to be best employer, but without a vacation in 7 years, i don't see that happening.They advertise being a union. The union, seiu, isn't the normal type of union. they are really called a union management partnership. Partnership with management does not define a union. Since this partnership, things went down hill.Being part of a union greatly increases wages, but it also keeps employees who do not do their fair share of work load. example: i may do 41 patients per day, while others do 3-10 per day. I don't care if others work, but watching patients wait for 2-3 hours to get lab work or other service is heartbreaking. They are only waiting for hours because management doesn't enforce employees to work, or they don't cover employees who are out on vacation or leave.This place is unethical with their harassing and bullying. If you sustain a work injury, they will harass you until you quit. Their human resources department are the worst harassers and they discriminate. Upper management only increases these behaviors if you report their actions.My department did a restructure, and they eliminated all evening shifts, having employees come in 1 hour earlier. Even though you still work evening shift ( ending after 6pm), you are considered day shift in order to not receive differential. I don't care about the money, Just want to be on evening shift in order to obtain a vacation. Currently, evening shift ration of people allowed off is approx 1 off per 6 employees. If you work day shift, ration is 2 off per 25 employees. At the least, make the ratios comparable. Day shift should allow at least 4 off if comparable to evening shift.Lastly, If you are a union rep, it seems all disciplines are omitted. Unfortunately, this is why most reps volunteer. They know they will not be disciplined or other if they are a union rep. Alot of the reps who volunteer are also the employees who do not do their fair share of work (lazy) and simply want any excuse to get out of work for numerous meetings and such.These reps do not care about helping anyone, and they only vote and implement in areas that benefit themselves. Currently, all reps say they will file a grievance, but never do. Look it up online and see all the grievances unresolved from seiu. The list doesn't include all the names of employees that were told they have a grievance in process , but really do not.|Read and adhere to your union contract. It states management will use its best efforts to back fill so employees can utilize there earned time off. We pay for this contract, even though union doesn't enforce it, management should if they ever want to be considered best place to work. How can Kaiser ever be considered best place to work when you are not able to ever take your family on a pre planned vacation to Hawaii or other. You cant even get approved for 1 consecutive week off, let alone 2 weeks. Whats the point of earning high $, if you can ever take a vacation? These vacations requests are set up a year in advance. Kaiser has ample time to back fill, in order to allow for employees to take a pre-planned vacation. Do you really think you will be voted as the best place to work when employees cant even get 1 consecutive week off requested 1 year in advance? Have worked at kaiser over 10 years now. I am not a new employee low on seniority list.|2.0

IT at Kaiser is optional|For a HealthCare organization, I'm sure Kaiser is pretty progressive. Compared to the rest of the world, not so much.|"IT is looked at as ""optional"" at Kaiser. The cutting edge technology in the company is IBM and LotusNotes. The amount of paid vacation and paid holidays is subpar. Salaries are low. And unless you chose to drink the Kaiser koolaid and have Kaiser insurance, the benefits are not only not that great they do not conform with the Health Care Reform Act which is hypocrisy at its finest since the healthcare plans provided to its members must conform.If you enjoyed IT in the 90s Kaiser is the place for you! Forget cutting edge, the technology used isn't even new. The entire company is segmented including IT. Cross-collaboration is nearly impossible and analysis paralysis reigns supreme! If you like to sit around and talk about doing things for months on end and then like to spend months making a decision this is the place for you!

Not female or mother friendly|Good pay and benefits, very competent medical staff|When the decision to turn KP Mid Atlantic into a profit center the current CEO understood increase number of paying patients and appointment slots available, not improve on internal management processes. As a result attrition rate is now 5 times higher in Mid Atlantic than other KP locations because of unrealistic expectations placed on physicians' shoulders. Unlike other KP locations last patient booking is later during the day and there is no specific time dedicated to administrative work by physicians. Thus, even experienced doctors end up working late in the evening, sometimes up to 9 pm. Furthermore, the current workload management is so mothers' unfriendly that many female doctors have resigned. This is obvious when you look at the gender imbalance among physicians which is currently heavily skewed towards male doctors.|Instead of focusing on revenue generation, you should place emphasis on making the company more efficient by revising workflows and internal procedures. It takes months to get anything accomplished, from a trivial software order to even issuing new business cards. This is symptomatic of a sub-optimal management culture. There are several ways to accomplish profitability, and its not just by sales. Furthermore, when doctors try to raise awareness on these and other issues the answer is not to send in a psychiatrist. This gives the unmistakable feeling that you are blaming the physician by placing the onus on his ability to 'cope' rather than trying to honestly understand the validity of his claims. This might help reduce physician's turnover and patients' frustration of having to deal with a new doctor every few months.|2.0

Hard to get approved for time off including vacations.|If staff put in extra time to help, then need time off for family, illness, treat them humane when they come back to work. When they work overtime to catch up as well as help out, try not to throw them under the bus to make yourself look better. Realize everyone is human and under stress and exhaustion do make slight errors. Scent the good rather than the occsionl mistake. Don't make employees feel threatened if their call times go down when they are quitting smoking or dealing with family emergencies. Ask yourself how you would like to be treated. Should you be given a second chance? Should you only have your down days judged? Would you treat kids this wy when you were five years old on the playground and if not, why are you doing it now?|2.0

Decent place to work but that's changing.|Overall, KP can be a pretty good place to work. The pay and benefits are pretty good though the company has begun moving away from this culture.|"KP's new mantra is ""Affordability"". This means the company is moving to a business model where work is understaffed and people are over worked. Additionally, big changes in benefits have already been introduced and new cuts are in the works. When companies move to such a place where their mission is to cut costs, rather than service patients, members and customers, the environment becomes toxic, employees stop working together and are only focused on saving their own jobs. That is the new KP."|Reduce costs by putting all of your efforts into improving patient care and outcomes rather than hitting your employees.|3.0

I found no help from HR or other mgrs who were just trying to hang onto their excessive high end salaries themselves (couldn't blame them for that).My only comfort is having seen other Directors come & go knowing he will get dumped eventually for some supposed performance reason when his boss feels her job is threatened.My best advice is to try and transfer to a unionized position when you turn 50 for some protection even if you have to take a lower salary.

All the time they say they're valuing their people, but you can tell by what's being done. Some departments have managers who will sacrifice their subordinates in the name of contributing to the bottom line to booster their position in the eyes of the upper management, and they intimidate/bully the employees beneath them. A lot of departments have an uneven distribution of work (i.e. some people work 'til they get sick literally, and some walk around with nothing to do). Many cliques as well.Only lip services are paid to work/life balance if you are in the non-union group. Hypocrites! The employee people pulse survey is a joke - if you tell the truth about anything not working well, employees are stuck with spending the time to come up with solutions (on top of their normal work duties). You get put in 2 to 3 of these groups and have to come up with activities, etc. to supposedly make the next round of scores better.

The trainers are not even equipped to teach all types of people and learning curves. This place is extremely Unprofessionalism, supervisors gossip amongst each other and they also gossip to those they supervise. I worked in member service and I can tell you the members were NOT our priority or concern. Getting members off the phone wether the issue was resolved or not was what was important. Most of the time promises to callback where made and not kept, just anything to get the member off the phone. Supervisors do not take control of the calls for irate or disgruntled members. In fact they didn't do anything but stay in their office, gossip, and hunt you down if you were on a call too long. If your a professional and looking for a place to thrive, please understand this is NOT the place. The ignorance, Incompetency, and Unprofessionalism will have you wanting to shoot yourself. These people do not put their members first and they do not educate or train new employees in a way that will educate them how to do their job!|Stop gossiping, do your job, go through the training for the department you work in so that you know answers to questions that your employees may ask, take initiative, take control of calls, stop making promises to members you never plan to keep.

Working with people who are less than 5 years from retirement is the most frustrating experience I have ever been apart of.

Truly disheartening.|"Please start adapting coaching and performance management for all employees. There are way too many employees with 10+ years of experience that are resistance to change and are becoming stale. Be innovative and not afraid of change. This is an old outdated workforce you have.

Great place to volunteer at|I was a junior volunteer here all throughout my high school years and it was a great way to meet people from other high schools in the area. We did a lot of busy work like handing paperwork to nurses, but this also gave us a lot of face time with the nurses, which allowed us to get familiar with what they had to do. We interacted a lot with the patients through discharging them, giving labor and delivery tours, and going to their room with a complimentary gift cart filled with all sorts of goodies to cheer them up. It was quite a rewarding experience.

A sad ending and very mixed feelings.|The best reasons to work for Kaiser Permanente-West Los Angeles would be the following: you like following rules, you enjoy structure and stability (after your first three years of uncertainty of course when you can be fired for any reason), and you crave certainly. Once you make partner anything short of a felony conviction cannot get rid of you. As long as you show up for work and do the bare minimum (and you don't mind the scorn of your peers and the occasional talking to) you can stay until retirement and finish with a cushy pension and retirement account. The number of sick days allowed are enormous, as are the number of vacation days. Bad behavior is not punished but rather rewarded as long as it does not cross over the line legally. If you have no conscience and want to practice medicine of least resistance, by all means, join this company.....Compensation is generous however if you add up the insurance and the sick/vacation leave. Work life balance is touted but is quite the joke. The pay structure for primary care is such that you are paid for 8 hours of clinic a day no matter how long you work. I generally worked 10-11 hours and was uncompensated so my real pay was much lower. The specialists are paid differently ( I know this because I was married to one and he would be paid for every moment he stepped into the building, and at higher and higher rates depending on the lateness of the hour).|Please see above. Somehow my pros devolved into cons. Upper management was so top heavy that it could barely balance. After 5-7 years there few people wanted to do the actual work of doctoring and tried to make the jump into administration with varying results. The overarching result however was that there were too few people seeing patients and too many people giving presentations.|"My advice would be, now that I have spent nearly a year working away from your system, to get back to the work of doctoring. If you are a doctor and you are not essential to a committee then go back to your office and do what you were trained to do. Doctors need to see patients. Most specialists that are internal medicine based can see basic primary care issues and take the gigantic burden off primary just the slightest bit. Take off the fancy suit a few days a week and get back in the office and start sweating like the rest of us. You are not as ""important"" as you think you are."|3.0

Work Life Balance|This review and views are as an employee's spouse only.We are a family of 4 with a 5 year old and 1 year old. My spouse works in the IT department in Kaiser.

As an example employee is forced to come for a dinner and drinks that goes on till 8:30PM in an outside restaurant without any consideration that the woman employee has a 1 year old. In another scenario, having a 'team building' in a remote location for 4 days and asking the employee to be in the remote location for an extended period of time and also asking the employee to stay there overnight.Being a spouse of the employee and having myself worked in enough IT companies in bay area, I have never seen any company ask/force employees to do anything like this. In any of my previous experience, the employer and manager would be the first to tell the employees to consider the young kids scenario and be available for such 'extra' events only as needed basis. On the contrary here, asking a woman employee to stay back in a remote location for 'team building' activities knowing the employee has a 1 year old child is irresponsible.|Kaiser has a great and evolving name in the field.

Please be very careful when agreeing to take a position of this caliber. This particular Kaiser was very vague on rules, training and office procedures. Instead of getting ongoing feedback regarding your performance, they consistently break you down. I felt the environment was unfair, my supervisors and managers were very difficult to get in contact with... it was a very disheartening experience for me.Nobody will speak up when it comes to equal treatment because nobody wants to lose their job.

What type of organization takes union dues out of a temporary worker's paycheck only to not have any type of representation when there is a problem. In my opinion, the supervisors and managers both took full advantage of employees during the probation period. Of course we wanted to speak up, but if we did, we would be terminated.

You do many hours of extra patient emails, prescription renewals, and phone calls. The support staff is largely medical assistants. Kaiser doesn't like to invest a lot in mid-level providers like RNs who could make our job easier. Why? because the physicians are salaried--it's cheaper for MD's to do this in the evening and weekends on their own time than provide professional-level support. You have to close charts, answer calls and emails within one day. You also have to work evening clinics and weekend clinics. They are slow to replace MDs who leave and this adds to the burden of coverage. As a result the work-life balance is poor.You can feel like an overpaid data-entry clerk and customer service representative. You will be given talks about ""providing excellent customer service."" It's hard to feel like a physician.I have several ethical concerns regarding how the company inserts itself in the doctor-patient interaction. The patients rate you and these ratings are partly used to decide whether you can stay in the Medical Group. [My ratings are actually on par with my group so this isn't just sour grapes]. Making sure the patients are ""satisfied"" promotes overprescription of antibiotics, narcotics and sedatives. Doctors need to be able to say ""no"" and have difficult conversations that aren't ""satisfying"". And, because Kaiser is an insurance company, patients occasionally worry we are ""trying to save money"" on their care. An example, if you make more specialist referrals than your colleagues, you will get ""dinged.""Specialists more likely to give a quick phone opinion and are less inclined to ""own"" patients and follow them for their chronic problem than in private practice.There is a corporate culture of ""Kaiser Kool-Aid"" about how great the system is. Smart doctors with ideas for improvement and contrary opinions are ignored because they don't reflect the unrealistically rosy view of management about the Kaiser system and our work lives.There are a lot of physician jobs. If you don't like following commands from management about how and when you work and don't embrace corporate medicine, then you will find a better fit elsewhere."|Look for ways to make your physicians' personal lives better.

The union is allowed to rule with little to no support from HR. The company is less worried about finding the right talent but instead if he/she meets their ethnic hiring metrics. It's very sad to see as this company historically has been a strong advocate of internal movement and development. I have been gone for over a year from KP and it was the best move I made.

Job satisfaction depends on your manager|If you have a manager that cares about his/her team, this is a good place to work. Work-life balance is possible with the right manager.|Under-qualified management makes for a very unpleasant work situation and low morale. Work-life balance is not company-wide and only applies if you have an understanding and flexible manager who values quality work and satisfied employees.|Need more checks and balances when hiring individuals into a managerial role, especially external hires. There needs to be substance to their qualifications, don't hire just because you think there may be a personality/corporate culture fit. Chances are the personality that you witnessed in the interview is not the one showing up to work. This produces low morale for the employees under this type of manager.|1.0
Awesome place to work.|Large pool of employees so there is always ways to get time off. Room for growth. Competitive salaries.|In my department we had new management and there was added work load for the same pay.|Listen to your employees.|5.0
Good Benefits, but poor working culture|If you are working for the Health Plan or Program Office, pay is below the industry average (around 30-40 percentile). Medical benefit is okay. However, PTO is pretty reasonable.|Dont expect any pay raise for the next couple years. KFHP basically freeze all its employees' salary in order to have enough money to raise the salary of the hospital and medical groups physicians.Promotion is terrible, but only happen annually.Work culture and communication are terrible. Resource allocation is a disaster. There are teams with large group of team members that takes months to finish projects that a person can finish it within a week.|Good team spirit leads to good service quality. Satisfying customers by squeezing out employees benefits will lead to bad customer experience.|3.0
Bureaucratic, hierarchical organization; hard to get things done|One of the last companies to offer a pension (after 5 years), as well as a 403b; also lots of vacation time but it becomes difficult to take time off because of reduced staffing. Training is mostly in new business processes because they are constantly changing; very little technical IT training, if at all.|Biggest issue is most of the IT middle management (and some senior) have very shaky credentials when closely examined. Most have no technical training or experience, no hands on technical that would be required elsewhere. Lots of crossovers from the business side with no technical training. Lots of certificates and degrees(if they have them) from for-profit diploma mills. The culture is like a small town's; promotions are usually based on relationships rather than actual experience. Poor and mediocre performers with good connections are protected.|Dump HR and bring in outside consultants - HR is part of the culture/problem|2.0

Seems great, but reality bites|An all inclusive, club like atmosphere to work. In offices, very community oriented, and supportive feeling. Corporate Kaiser feels like a great place to work.|Hospital Kaiser, not a very cohesive place to work. Many units seems unsafe in the floor nursing area. Managers do not seem to listen to their nurses, that same spirited feeling in the corporate side does not flow over into the hospital and patient care areas as well.|Actually practice what you preach. Many nurses are not on board with Kaiser's work approach, and they should be. Listen to your employees more, and have that spirited part of Kaiser really shine throughout all areas.

The company needs new mangers, directors with new ideas with strong leadership. The managers take everything personal and if they don't like you, they would do anything to get you out of the door.|Get rid of the whole top management staff and start over with people who are people oriented, has leadership skills, and truly care about the well being of the organization.

Good company going through massive change|Very mission-driven organization. Many very good people who are passionate about their work. For the most part KP encourages work-life balance.|Some unnecessary internal turf wars. The key to landing a good situation within KP is finding a group that's healthy and productive, and that supports work-life balance. Health care reform is putting pressure on the organization in many ways. Related: a wave of staff cuts has begun and it won't end soon.|Make time to meet with all staff one-on-one.

KP Georgia Region: Too Much Work|(I am a salaried, non-clinical employee in the regional offices.)As an employee and a member, your health coverage is practically free.KP Georgia has a very diverse workforce.Leadership is less diverse, but still impressively so for the corporate world.Vacation time is pretty good and your accrual rates and caps increase with time at the company (but sick and vacation time come out of the same bucket).When you do get laid off, the package is very good.You get to work with some pretty smart people.|"Resumes detailing impressive careers but no college degrees will almost certainly be rejected.Salaries are weak. (But of course all employers always say that your salary is commensurate with the market.)The workloads are just grotesque. Not a single one of my department-mates or internal customers does the work of ""only"" one person. Your team gets slashed even though the incoming work is increasing. I know one group that was cut from six people to one.The best way to move up is to move sideways.They have the worst 401k matching I've ever heard of.Times are too tough for salary increases this year. But next year everything will be wonderful. (repeat every year)Travel budgets are supposedly cut to zero, but you might bump into an entire team that flew out just for meet and greets. Teleconference rooms sit largely unused.In some departments, the concept of work/life balance is a myth.Empty offices abound; you must stay in your cubicle.Sometimes you wonder if it really is more about who you know than what you know.You have to work with some pretty dumb people."|Stop letting lower management decide what work/life balance means.

Kaiser is good for families|Ir you are looking for a positive worklife balance this is the company for you.|Career growth is very slow at KP.

It was a most enjoyable first experience in the medical field.|Working in the clinics as a float gave me the opportunity to gain knowledge in a wide variety of fields. It made me quite versatile and gave me insight as well as guidance on what I was really interested in and what I was not so interested in.|At the time I worked there there seemed to be less teamwork and more competitiveness. If you worked closely with your doctor and didn't participate in the negative gossip then soon you would not be approached with it as you would have made it known that you were not interested in that sort of thing. You learn to work with people with a smile regardless of what they say under their breath about anything or anyone. You are there for your patients not to be a target for your coworkers.|I think that Kaiser is ran quite efficiently if attention is payed to the finer qualities of a person and they are placed where they will be most productive.

Very clique-y along with a High School mentality, and rampant with favoritism.|"The Pay. I was(or I was supposed to be) part of the Union meaning better pay and benefits. Great health insurance, meaning I didn't have to ""leave work"" to see my physician. Received mileage for training."|"I was very excited to work here in the very beginning. However I should have taken heed to the negative reviews from former employees as well as the legal trouble Kaiser is ALWAYS in. Kaiser is always being sued by either a patient or a former employee. I was terminated during my probation period over hearsay.The 70-something days I was there, I only saw my supervisor TWICE for maybe a few hours. Yet she claimed she received all these complaints about my attitude and my work attire: she claimed someone said I was wearing jeans and a mini-skirt. Yes...a mini-skirt. And she was so convinced that this was true, despite only being at my work location twice. How would she know if I violated dress code if she was almost NEVER there? I had never heard a word about anything I was doing wrong until the day I was fired. Nothing.Now to my coworkers: lazy. I was left to my own devices many times due to my coworker either picking up her car at 3pm (not allowed, by the way), and holding long conversations with her husband or other employees while patients are waiting to be served. Day after day, I was handling the window and the phones on my own because my coworker didn't feel like working. Yet no one complained about that. Not to mention, on one occasion, we ""lost"" a patient's school form. My coworker did not document where she left the form and the patient made a complaint to my department manager. After some research, we found it upstairs in another department (as the patient was coming in over the weekend for some other business). My department manager actually blamed the front desk clerk in the OTHER department for not giving the form to the patient....and NOT my coworker, who failed to document where she put the form in the first place. That should have been my first red flag, because documentation is EVERYTHING in a Medical Records department.I did file a complaint about HIPAA violations to OCR. Maybe that had something to do with my termination. But hearsay does not hold up in any court, INCLUDING unemployment. Which of course I won because Kaiser could not produce any evidence of my wrongdoing. The shock and the pain of being fired has worn off, because I hold myself to a high standard, and I do not operate well in a high-school work environment that is rampant with favoritism. Despite losing my income(which was GREAT) I am glad to be gone."|It wouldn't kill you to frequent your designated locations so you can see how employees are REALLY working. And to upper management, you need to be VERY CAREFUL who you hire as a manager in a meticulous department such as Medical Records and Health Information. Patients cannot afford lazy and incompetent employees handling their private medical information.|1.0

There was good career growth and leadership supported improving employees skills and education.|In Ohio we had horrible C level executives. KP in general has a certain hubris that they are the biggest and best. I saw this arrogance as playing a large part in Ohio's downfall. Leadership and marketing failed to notice the market pressures and their rebranding solution was ill advised. KP is a large institution. Because of this it's hard to institute change in a timely manner. In regions that KP is not dominant, that slow to change environment can lead to it's decline. I watched as cuts were made and as that occurred, the patient experience declined.

This is a gigantic perk for me, and I realize that not all teams at KP do this.|- Working here (at least in info security) is incredibly stressful. Lots of off-hours work, on-call shifts, and constant frenzied pace throughout the day. Not uncommon for people to have health problems from stress.- No one knows how to get anything done. New employee that needs access to certain resources? Your manager will have no idea where to look, neither will your teammates.- Bad/non-existent documentation for processes.- Management doesn't receive adequate training. Most of them are either completely absent or totally micromanaging and won't back you up when you need them.- Revolving door of contractors. As soon as they get up to speed and have good knowledge of our domain, they're forced out the door. They're also treated poorly compared to FTEs.- Below market salary. They think the benefits make up for this, but not really. I've begun searching for new positions and they've all paid 20-40k more for similar work.- Constant re-orgs, followed by 20 meetings of executive-speak trying to explain why the re-org needed to happen.- Told you can move to a new team, but you'll never hear back on internal applications unless you know the hiring manager. I've seen this happen multiple times.- Nepotism. Someone gets promoted to manager and brings a bunch of their friends to work for them, even though they're not qualified. I've seen this on several teams.|"- Hire more FTEs, not temporary contractors. Due to understaffing, employees are sick with stress and work/life balance is awful.- Provide better training to managers. At past companies, I felt I could rely on my manager and that they had good knowledge of the company and how to navigate it. Here, if you ask management a question, the response is usually ""I don't know."" Doesn't instill much confidence.- Pay better. The workload for many of us in security is tremendous and the hours are brutal. The benefits here really ARE great, but they don't make up for salary being dramatically below market rate."|2.0

Personal growth is little to none. TOO MUCH DRAMA IN THE OFFICE. HIRING PROCESS SLOW; HARD TO GET FOOT IN THE DOOR. Promotions are nil to none. Training is basically figuring it out yourself.

Failing Corporate Organization...Run Don't Walk|"KP has improved its reputation clinically speaking compared to the 80's ""I don't want Kaiser...I want to live"" reputation. A lot of the people who work here seem grateful to just have a job (""working retired"", ""poorly educated"", etc.) when they would otherwise be working service industry or retail. If benefits matter to you more than a competitive salary (you are a secondary earner in your household), then I can see how KP would appeal to some people because they are gold plated. Admittedly, there are a lot of plum jobs for people who get into middle management ""non-contributor"" positions, but I would not count on that remaining for much longer. Pension for those who stay past 5 years. Once again, a lot is going to have to change around here shortly because of competitive pressure kicking in. It already has begun."|"This is the most appalling run organization of its size in the world. Seriously, I think large parts of the federal government are better run than this house of cards/rubbish dump. Organizations rot from the head, and Kaiser Permanente suffers from this acutely. The ""leadership"" is absolutely terrible and completely out of their league when they are not just being flat out corrupt, nepotism, blatantly political, etc.. This trickles down to middle management which is very insecure, does not listen to their employees about staffing or resource concerns, and then acts very hands off until something big breaks and they start knifing people in the back out of contempt. Due to many of the rash decisions being made currently, the last good people with a few neurons to rub together are resigning, changing industries altogether, or taking early retirement. The core IT systems are a completely balkanized joke and show decades of mismanagement and neglect which could be enough to sink the organization by itself in this new day and age. Doctors and clinical folks have way too much say in corporate where they frequently know nothing. The HR organization appears to have been co-opted by union/diversity agenda people who help contribute to the equal opportunity, egalitarian, let mediocrity reign/""let's hire the least qualified/cheapest person we can possibly find who might have a prayer of holding down this job"" heck hole of a work gulag full of demotivating incompetents that is KP."|"Pull your head out of you nether regions, listen to the people on the ground who are actually working, and lay off the toxic, insecure ""Old Kaiser"" administrative do-nothings, professional box checkers, and other middle management morons. Take some of those huge savings and raise the salaries of key contributors by 20-30% to be market competitive, give them the resources to overhaul stupid old ways of doing things, and use the rest to begin lowering rates for our members. It would not be that difficult if you were not so debilitatingly, awe-inspiringly stupid."|1.0

Seems to be moving towards a strategy of managing and not necessary leading in a crisis -- employees seems to be looked at more as a liability that an asset for the company -- managers are picked based on who you know and not necessarily on what you know -- many veterans are leaving to escape the finger pointing when least experienced managers feel insecure of more knowledgeable and more deserving employees|Should not overlook those folks who got you to where you are (in the years where the bottom line was in the black) as you attempt to move forward and grow your brand in Georgia -- your employees can be your greatest sales force if you put your trust in your entire team and not just your management team -- Don't look at folks with constructive criticism as if they are not team players, especially if they have been with you for almost two decades and had not been a problem -- The corporate office need to review HRs policy concerning age discrimination and the use of negative and biased evaluations when team unity is problematic should be stressed with management team.|3.0

Frustrating and exhausting working for this organization|Good benefits and good starting salary.|"Working for Kaiser is like working for the government: It pays the bills but is less than rewarding. Financial rewards are not based upon personal performance. If you are a non-union Health Plan employee annual salary increases do not keep pace with inflation and everyone receives the same 1.5% regardless of contribution. There is no ""work life balance"" at Kaiser, contrary to the expressed platitude. Management is definitely top down and results in many inefficiencies due to a lack of rank and file participation in process decisions. Kaiser is the typical large corporation that cannot foster anything entrepreneurial without ultimately crushing it in bureaucratic red tape and a desire to force every productive square peg into an inappropriate round hole."|In today's challenging financial environment, management needs a new appreciation for individual employee productivity. They need to develop a personal performance reward system that distinguishes top performers throughout the organization. Stop advertising work life balance until there is truly an opportunity for employees to experience this.

Great place to work with many avenues of career expansion.|Great compensation and work/life balance. I worked on-call for 3.5 years and short hour (16 hr/week) for the latter 1.5 years of my employment, being able to work on average of 24-32 hours a week by picking up additional hours. The atmosphere around the hospital is generally positive, and there are a lot of neat events to partake in such as the Friday Farmer's Market and wellness celebrations at the adjacent Mosswood Park.|"Favoritism was a major culprit in this department's lackluster management. Even as I often voluntarily covered specific shifts workable around my schedule from those who called in sick, I found myself reassigned elsewhere with double workload because another cross-covering lab assistant didn't want to ""do a different job title's work."" Complaining to the manager only resulted in me being admonished because I ""wasn't being a team player."" If you work here, bond with your co-workers, as they generally want to help and defend you.Also, transferring to another facility can deem difficult because most other facilities are under a different bargaining unit."|Please listen to your employees; many of the veteran techs, scientists, and support staff know what they are doing. if you want to change something, seek input from and work with them since making numbers and figures more efficient doesn't always necessarily translate well on the bench.|4.0

Former Employee|Kaiser is a great company to work for. Great benefits and compensation. Depending on your supervisor, there are a lot of opportunities and they want you to have a life and work balance. It is like a big family not only within your own department but with other departments as well. Many of the employees here take much pride being apart of Kaiser and are usually with the company for long duration.|There is a management disconnect, many of the departments do not communicate among each other, causing there to be a ripple in communication.

Senior Management will initially tell you you are doing a great job and say they are supporting you but when their backs are against the wall you are left to fend for yourself. Butt kissing and back stabbing go a long way with helping you get to the top. Don't ever cross anyone in senior leadership, you will be blacklisted. This is even if you've never been placed on an action plan and have had good/great evaluations. Finally, union employees, you may have grounds to terminate or issue a corrective action but if they are long term employees they are allowed to return to work through the arbitration process or by the union business rep having a relationship with senior management.|Transparency in the truest form is key.

The use sametime to communicate with co-workers, but most are very good at ignoring the pings or put sametime on ""in a meeting"" so they do not have to be bothered....Also new policy is to only hire the young."|None of the managers have much respect from the employees over the last year.|3.0
Scheming, Incompetent Managers at the top|"Many terrific, dedicated people work for Kaiser Permanente - in the middle ranks. Let's hope they will ""thrive"" to do some good in the world."|"Kaiser Permanente is top-heavy with incompetent do-nothings internally called ""Old Kaiser"". They almost sank the whole system over their rush to take over the prestigious Electronic Health Record positions that they didn't understand. On the ""business side"" looking the part came to mean more than technical knowledge: in fact ""technical people"" were regarded as contingent labor to be used and thrown away.While I worked as a mere project coordinator, the insight I got into the highest level workings of Kaiser was enough to make me never want to work for that company again. I was hired after a year of working as a temp. The first thing my new manager did was try to elicit dirt on another manager I had been assigned to. When I demurred, she tried to bring up the subject in other ways. Finally she dragged me into a meeting with the Director of the department and told him that she thought I was afraid to talk about the problems with this former manager, whom she was apparently trying to set up to be fired.When I still refused to cooperate, she started to make a big show of building a file AGAINST ME. When I had technical problems with my computer and sent an email notice that I had to miss a staff meeting because I was with tech support, she sent an email documenting how she had explained to me that it was a job requirement that I attend staff meetings. Then she asked for me to give her a list of everything I liked and disliked about my job *IN WRITING*. She continued to disguise her actions against me by sending me to get a new ergonomic chair for my desk. But the very next day after that, she called me into her office to fire me: it turned out she could fire me for no reason at all since I was still in my probation period.I did attempt to complain to Human Resources, but apparently she had already been calling them for weeks, and they had been arming her for how to legally terminate an employee, whether there was cause or not! I then went through the months long process of appeals. This turned out to amount to asking the manager whether she would consider taking me back. My appeal was rejected the day before Christmas.It outrages me that a manager in a large, respected company like Kaiser, in such a high level department, could get away with this sort of scheming, manipulative behavior - and then just fire anyone who doesn't cooperate with her. As far as I know she has continued to rise in the ranks, while I was thrown out on the street.As for the general level incompetence - I saw that all over the office. But the most appalling thing was the Indian programmers. I don't say that to be racist: India has great technical education, and the programmers that went through that education system deserve a lot of respect. But the guys I'm talking about were hired simply because they were Indian and they *looked* like programmers! They were calling their buddies for how to do their job all the time! Worse, they were calling me! I was more technical than they were, and I was being paid clerical wages while they were being paid over $100k a year and getting to go to conferences! There is something wrong with the way hiring managers stereotype people in this country. Working at Kaiser really made me cynical because I had to see that there are a lot of people who lie on their resumes, and have a whole system set up to lie on their recommendations, and they end up in great jobs. And then there are honest people like me who know things because they read a lot, but they have no one to vouch for them, and they make chicken-scratch because they are nerds who don't network. In a way I'm glad I didn't work at Kaiser long, because that environment would have made me bitter about life."|"First, clean house on ""Old Kaiser"". Stop associating looks with competence, and stop hiring on the basis of stereotypes. If there are rumors about certain managers constructing elaborate schemes to get other managers fired, check them out - it just might be true. Also, HR should reconsider the wisdom of always being on the manager's side against the lower-level employee: sometimes they should just advise the manager not to be such a jerk."|1.0

The Employee Resource groups are amazing and really promote the importance of professional and personal growth. There are many talented individuals who work hard to get their message across and help others succeed.|There is little to no room for growth for minorities in this organization. Unfortunately, preferential hiring and promotion runs abundant in this organization. The company tends to be less focused on talent and more on politics. Putting people in roles where they aren't the most efficient, just so they can please the higher ups. Backdoor reference, backdoor hiring, you name it, it's the culture here. There are some extremely talented minorities that work for this organization, that don't get the exposure to key projects and roles. HR in particular doesn't develop their employees, which is ironic. Year end reviews are more of an opportunity to justify why increases and bonuses won't be dispersed vs helping the individual grow and develop in their careers. Truly talented people have left this organization and flourished elsewhere. And with no exit interview strategy in place, there is no way for Management to know how to improve this.|"Your organization has potential to be a world class organization. But you need to pay attention to your hiring practices. Hold Hiring Leaders accountable for their actions, stop cutting HR/Recruitment budgets and hire more talented individuals that can sustain your mission. Help hungry employees develop, listen to their feedback and ideas, allow them to contribute more frequently. Stop creating new processes without the input of those in the front line.

Stifling Incompetence and Dysfunctional Leaders in Georgia Region|A few great colleagues who want to learn and do more to advance KP's mission.|"1. An astonishing bait and switch from the interview process to being brought on board. You will end up being hired and then not be allowed to do your job.2. There are a lot of threatened people here who fear the competence of others, which means you've got teams of incompetent people who are not held accountable for their own performance.3. You'll literally be told to be mediocre and to slow down your motivation to do your job well.4. You'll be discouraged from doing your best or exploring and presenting other ways to improve processes.5. You will not be allowed to interface with your cross functional colleagues around the nation without ""permission"" -- which really means that you are not trusted to do your job or to be an adult. Managers and directors here want to claim your successes no matter how small, and if they can't they'll get rid of you.6. You'll quickly tire of the politics that don't yield anything good or useful. You may even be told directly that you need to make your ideas seem like they are the ideas of others less competent than you-- instead of being supported by your leader.7. Many often end up reporting into an incompetent, so-called managers who lack professionalism. Some are even allowed to exercise their personal biases, dislikes, and jealousy against you.8. If you try to do your best, you'll literally be told NOT to, and you may be hated for being professional and articulate.9. If you come from Fortune 500 companies, are at the top of your game and try to share best practices that can benefit the business, you'll be told ""we've never had anyone like you."" You'll be told ""we move slower than what you're used to."" But you'll never be told that you can actually help improve things because you won't be allowed to do so.10. The marketing and sales departments have either lost or ousted highly competent people, but the common denominators in those situations are are a particular manager and director.11. In some departments, there are so-called managers that do not know anything (which would not be so bad if they knew how to lead and manage people and processes), yet they are allowed to remain and stifle others that are exceptionally talented and competent.12. Managers and directors are not hired due to their skills and knowledge -- they are hired because they are friends and family of others entrenched in the organization at higher levels, or because the region fears a discrimination lawsuit if they try to rid themselves of incompetent people who have been hanging on and collecting a paycheck with a sense of entitlement."|"Dr. Tyson,You need to seriously consider dismantling the Georgia region's sales and marketing departments and make them report into and follow the national sales and marketing functions; the staff could sit in the region but they need to be held accountable to those who set the pace nationally AND know what they are doing from a strategic level. There is some much redundancy, poor uncoordinated systems and waste! And, please take a hard look at the sales and marketing VPs you have in place right now: they have made some really bad business decisions in areas that are clearly not their forte, and they should step down. There are many reviews about them here and elsewhere -- including your own intranet.The Georgia region is wasting money when it comes to marketing and isn't following the right strategy and guidelines to maximize membership. People at the helm of this effort don't know what they are doing here and they don;t know how to activate and measure efforts, nor will they allow those that do know how to do so. This region is also known for harboring stagnant-minded, ill-adjusted and ill-informed staff who boldly cut down and stifle others outright when they speak up with good ideas or suggestions. There are several directors and managers who don't know how to make decisions, are contradictory and don't know what they are doing. But: they are very good actors. There are many in the region who want to see KP grow and know what to do, however the region often projects an attitude that suggests that following national's lead as much as possible for consistency while tailoring some efforts to the region is a bad thing.You should also know that there is an especially troubling manager who is so unprofessional that it shows daily in ignorant and inappropriate comments and conversations, very poor attitude when peers ask for assistance, lack of collaboration, dishonesty and plain old ignorance in conducting any kind of business, period. This person has actually lied on new (and old) staff and has consistently and purposely misrepresented various situations to manipulate them and others for her benefit. This person's lies and insecurities have cost several people their jobs in the recent span of two years. This person has made derogatory statements about the sexual preferences of others and forced two people out of the department on this basis, and it is known. This person also backbites the director of the department and other colleagues, talking about them behind their backs as if they are stupid or wrong for wanting to do their jobs well. Yet this ignorant, incompetent person remains! This person has stated that ""winning"" is most important to them, no matter the cost -- which is certainly a liability to you from a legal perspective. The day will come when the organization will be sued due to the actions and words of this individual. Check with the HR function to get a better sense of the risks to your organization in the form of bad managers and directors who do not know how to effectively manage, motivate or retain people.KP claims to be a culture of ""nice"" but it's really ""nicely nasty"" unless you know someone or have a cosign of someone who is liked despite their lack of skills and experience -- all very immature and unnecessarily political. You just can't keep claiming to want to help people thrive when you treat your own staff so very poorly.What a disappointment. I'll be moving on quickly."|2.0

Overall Good Experience; Bad Apples Spoil The Bunch|Pay, benefits, flexibility, and potential for career advancement.|I actually have a fairly good job, am getting paid the most I ever have in my working career, and have an excellent relationship with my supervisor. However, the problems lie with the union rules making it hard to fire bad employees. I am one of the good apples among a bunch of rotting fruit. About 95% of my coworkers have worked at Kaiser for more than 10 years and have become lazy, immature, miserable, constant complainers who treat people like crap and act like the office is a high school classroom instead of a workplace. Most of them are also not trying to change their situation, but will gripe about any changes that take place within Kaiser or our department that does not directly benefit them somehow.With that, my supervisor and union representatives highly encourage employees to use the education benefits that are offered to us. So, if one does wish to transition out of his or her current position into another one within Kaiser, all one has to do is go back to school, pick a major that is of interest, let Kaiser pay for the majority of it, and move forward.Working in the type of atmosphere I described in the first paragraph can be discouraging and cause low morale; however, I continue to do above and beyond my best. My supervisor is not to blame, as managers and supervisors can't immediately get rid of the bad employees or hold back their raise due to union rules. If it were just myself and the other employees who actually do the work that we were hired to do and my supervisor in the office, I would LOVE IT, and give Kaiser five stars!Aside from all this, the company has been focusing quite a lot on staying healthy and also giving rewards to employees for maintaining good health/practicing healthy behaviors, which is more than any other company for which I have worked, so I give them a thumbs up for that.Overall, I think Kaiser is a good company to work for, just need a better system to get rid of the slackers.|Work harder to get rid of bad employees and get them out as fast as you can!|4.0

"That's Not My Job"" - Anymore"|Kaiser Permanente is a huge and growing company with a heart to match.

Diversity is a given and all are made to feel welcome.|"There exist a pervasive attitude of ""That's Not My Job,"" which paralyzes team effort and any cooperation among employees or departments. Answering machines are the norm and talking to an actual live person a rarity. Every department has built self-imposed walls around itself to isolate themselves from the Customers / Members both internal and external. Frankly, it makes the company look lazy. All Member contact is routed through centralized call centers where the Member Service Representatives are expected to be the Oracle of Delphi knowing literally every detail about Kaiser Permanente from A to Z. This in an entire industry that is shrouded in double talk and confusing industry specific terminology, and Kaiser Permanente is not the exception. It is nearly impossible to get a straight answer out of anyone regarding anything, especially if you happen to be the customer wanting to know the cost of the care you will be receiving. Only in the Healthcare Industry are customers expected to spend tremendous sums of money so blindly and seemingly willingly without knowing the price tag beforehand, and Kaiser Permanente has no problem perpetuating the mystery of the final bill."|"Stop all the double talk and stop using all the insurance lingo. The American people know its a rigged game from the get go. The least they should be able to do is understand it.

Positive advice and feedback is frequently lacking.They have adopted a strategy of splitting certain positions between facilities, which sounds good and looks good on paper, but in practice it is disruptive and inefficient. Other problems are lazy and uncooperative staff nurses who have huge entitlement issues. Local management lacks the skill to manage these difficult cases, so they drag everyone down.|Get some leaders for the local facilities. Remember, managers are not necessarily leaders. Although we all know no one is indispensable, please don't treat people like one nurse is as good as another. Have some respect for the workers who do a good job.

Racial discrimination & blacklisted for standing up for your rights.|Pay is in the top % for nurses however, you pay for it in the end.|Can't speak for the other states however, Georgia Kaiser Permanente is one of the worst places to work if you are Caucasian and/or believe in standing up for your rights. The moment you question authority you are blacklisted & it becomes only a matter of time before you are gone.

Not as good as it sounds|Good Salary, somewhat a job security|Long hours of work, enormous amount of paper work and processes, company freeze for the past 5 years so current employees have had to take the burden by working long hours, because of the benefits, many people don't leave, while they don't have any acclimation or feel sense of urgency to do their job duties, the burden falls on the limited people who are ultimately responsible for the projects, strict employee rules and compliance regulations to the extent of not using computers for personal tasks, no holiday parties, no gift to be accepted over $25. So what this all translates to is hard and long hours of work, no employee perks, unhappy, unmotivated employes, and poor quality of life. No raise and yes, the salary is decent.|Cut the paper work, having to chase after paper all day long can get very frustrating, find ways to motivate people by salary incentives, periodic group luncheons. Hire employees to relieve the burden from current employees, but when you do, provide them with adequate training. It's unbelievable that we have to put long hours in training people in addition to our own hours of work. We , the employees are Kaiser memebers as well. We deserve to have an opportunity to Thrive.

If you're not able or willing to work like a circus elephant you are warned and eventually fired. As a health care company and one that promotes ""Thrive"" for their employees, they have it all wrong."|"Everyone realized it's a competitive world, but when you have a sweat shop expectation and are a ""Health Care Provider"" you need to walk the walk.

Contractors treated badly|Perm employees know their stuffWork can be challenging|"- Perm employees are tired to retraining contractors because they rehire for every project vs hiring people for sustainability or continuity. Contractor acquire a lot of knowledge so much after a 2 year project then they are let go to save money.- Oppressive working conditions in Pleasanton kaiser basically put 6 contractors into a small room.- I see projects show ""on track"" without any questioning.- Pay rate is very low about 20% lower than what other companies offer.- They give you a ton of work but say nobody put over 40hrs on their timecard. You need to ask for approval first but I often got a load of work dumped on me on a thursday, fri, or day before a long weekend that was due monday.Anytime I see a job opening from Kaiser IT, I know it's not worth the effort, conditions nor pay rate."|Find a way to rate and retain good contractors. Keep a portion of your permanent employee base fresh and not at the political mercy of the perm employees that have self serving goals. Ask hard questions in projects that have contractors on board and find a way to get information from them.

Life at KP|People fortunate to work here love working here because the benefits are exceptional, Let's start with vacation - most companies feel it's generous to give three weeks of paid vacation. At KP you start with that or a smidge more and accrue with years worked. When I left I had 7.5 weeks of paid vacation. How many other employers in the US offer that? Because it's an HMO you get comprehensive health care, that begins as soon as you're hired, and if you work there long enough, your health care will be there after you reach 65. The pay is very comparable and they compensate you financially quite fairly and even generously. If you happen to be part of management, you are compensated even greater. Not many company have pensions they can offer you but KP still has that and you get vested rather quickly for it. Again, people want to work for this company because it still has excellent benefits, even compared to its earlier years when the benefits were beyond stellar. This is why Kaiser Permanente holds on to its work force because the grass isn't greener next door at least financially and benefits wise.|Like any business you are employed at, much has to do with the environment. Kaiser Permanente is your typical corporate structure that is both macro and micro. Macro in a bad sense that you feel you are barely a cog in the massive system that makes it work. Micro in the sense that in the end you're still dealing with people who can be pernicious, petty, vengeful, spiteful and these are your supervisors, managers, management and at times your co-workers. Kaiser Permanente promotes its work environment as positive but it is anything but that, especially if you have horrible bosses which is the norm and not the exception. As a corporation that works dutifully to cultivate its public perception, the reality is that KP is not remotely close to its 'spin.' If KP was such a great place to work for, other than benefits, than how you can explain why its own employment assistance program (EAP) and other mental wellness programs are overwhelmed by its own employees. It's not a healthy place to work, even though it promotes that 'healthy' message to its customer base. Both upper and lower management is incredibly inept and is rewarded for being so, and again. People continue to work there because the benefits are the only thing that keeps it bearable and the fact the job market is super bleak. Again, I only recommend Kaiser Permanente as a place to work because the benefits are very good but that is changing - so get in while those benefits exist and be prepared to be supervised and managed by someone who should never been made a manager or supervisor ever.|This is what I would say to any corporate CEO, CFO, president, those who really have the power to change their companies - quit making the little people as accountable as the people who are managing/supervising them. 'We' 'little people' will walk through a wall if we are managed by people we know are competent and treat us respectfully. Making us, the little people, attend mandatory Team building exercises or that other 'rah rah', 'you make a difference' and whatever trendy better workforce system and seminars is pointless and demeaning. Don't punish the 'arm' for what the 'hand' does. If anyone needs more training to be better at their jobs, it's management. Quit spewing the lies that input from the lowest of employees matters. Be realistic about why people, who aren't management, work for you. Work on your managers and supervisors to be better people first and then better managers and supervisors. Use common sense and quit bringing in consultants to figure out why things don't work when everyone already knows why it's not working, especially since the first course of action is micromanagement which never works. Management needs to quit hiding behind any facade where it's 'business' when dealing with those they manage. Truth is, it's not 'business' but it's 'personal' and because it's personal, any management clarity and neutrality is lost. Quit making the little people fill out surveys on how the company can improve and quit telling people it's anonymous. No non management employees believe their input is valued or anonymous. It seems these surveys are more of a tool to weed out the malcontents and anyone who values their job, tows the corporate line. Everyone knows, management wants to laud itself and does take credit of an idea submitted by a lowly employee. Also to management, maybe your business wouldn't get sued as much as it does if your human resources department was just an extension of everything wrong with your company in the first place. Quit calling it 'human' resources and call it what it really is, 'business preservation' or 'business enforcement' resources. Most people have actual/real cause when they go to HR but then are immediately treated as a pariah or 'trouble for the company.' Quit punishing the employees when it's management that is mostly at fault. You, management, spend too many resources to avoid staring reality in the face. Again, all that team building crap or worker improvement seminars, seriously - focus on the people leading your teams and improve those people and let the employees, if competent and good at what they do, continue. Quit rewarding incompetent managers and punishing those working under them for their manager's incompetence. Punish and remove managers who are reactionary extremists for their own incompetence. Last, get rid of performance evaluations and appraisals except for top management. Performance evaluations/appraisals are a waste of time and the same input is rewritten over and over with just more embellishment than actual meaningful content. It's just a waste of resources, energy, and if a manager dislikes someone working under them, just another opportunity to exploit that person. If you do your diligence and bring in capable people in the first place, quit questioning their capability, wasting their time, by undermining them and making them prove their worth in a means that doesn't quantify or record it accurately or at all. If these horrible things have to exist, can we at least make them check boxes or true and false and be allowed to write in 'real' answers to questions as stupid as, 'Please list your accomplishments for this year' to someone who does the same minor thing over and over to, 'I still have a job and am grateful for it.' The only pertinent questions that is ever asked is more or less how can you improve what you do and that is relevant. However, the majority of questions are inane and inapplicable like 'Stretch Goals' and how can you save this company and the world type questions. There are never questions that might actually make sense for someone so far on the low end of the corporate structure. Performance evaluations and appraisals were created by bad management who don't have the cognitive skills to see what's actually happening in real time and need to assuage them of their own incompetence as managers.|2.0

After several years of observation and sharing experiences with many people, in my opinion upper management does not care about their employees whatsoever.

There are some really great people, working under really tough circumstances.|Some of the worst management I've experienced in over 30 years of work! I also feel like they spend more on marketing than on patient care, and corners are always cut. The marketing is like a monster, and not even accurate. It's very management and administratively TOP-Heavy! The politics are insane and too much power is in the hands of the wrong people. Partners do pretty well, but are often overworked. There seems to be some shady stuff going on, and a lot of lip service, but the experience isn't what it seems. Crummy managers get promoted as long as they butter up those above them. Needs more emphasis on patient care and less on numbers and faulty information. Not enough transparency. Some of the unions are too involved in what doesn't matter, and not involved enough in what does. It's hard to main pride and respect when one sees hypocrisy and two-faced behaviors.|"Know your staff. Spend time with them and let their assets shine. Neither patients nor people are made from cookie cutters, so allow reasonable leeway. Reduce the number of meetings. Focus on medicine and not on red tape, papers, reports, and bad data. Trust your employees unless they give you reason not to. Stop ""bullying"". Stop gossiping. Care. Support your staff and don't scold or blame them. We know there is pressure from on high, but look at the bigger picture. Don't micro-manage, especially among independent, advanced, learned staff. Merit should count more than seniority.

More transparency needed in the workplace|"Positives of working at Kaiser:- Nice campus at Pleasanton including privacy booths for personal phone calls (or conference calls without bugging others), free Peet's coffee, tea, or hot chocolate, and a small gym free to employees- The people (non-managers) are good people, very pleasant to work with, and want to get the job done- Kaiser has a point that fee-for-service health plans incentivize doctors for lots of services/tests/activity rather than member health- Kaiser does manage to do things in terms of research that no one else can- George Halverson's ""celebratory"" emails every Friday afternoon remind us that health care is different than most other workplaces (and of the things that Kaiser can do that others cannot). (George Halverson was the CEO of Kaiser until July 2013.)- If your group is not busy, you usually manage work-life balance and close to a 40-hour workweek- If you must travel a longer distance than to your ""normal"" workplace, such travel is paid for by Kaiser (mileage only if less than an hour's drive away, ""full"" travel costs beyond that)- Kaiser does not discriminate based on age and is willing to train people for a skill when they realize that skill is not readily available in the local workforce- Good vacation policy: 17 days off the first year, 22 days off the second year, increasing further after 5 years on the job- Kaiser ""Healthtalks"" - you can learn all sorts of interesting information to improve your own health monthly (this is also available to members on the Kaiser health plan)- Relatively low monthly premiums for health care compared to other employers""Neutral"" things about working at Kaiser:- This place is very project-oriented with matrix management- If you want to work from home, you can do so easily in most IT jobs (although in some areas, you're now required to go to the office one day per month for networking reasons)- Because so many people work from home, the culture is to get things done with instant messages (via Lotus Sametime), Webex, and phone conferences"|"Negatives of working at Kaiser:- Politics. Management politics will cause ""strange"" things to happen (for example, multiple groups doing the same thing even though that is a waste of money).- Lack of transparency. When I started this job, I asked about overtime and was told (correctly) that there wasn't much overtime. However, they failed to tell me until after I was hired that strange shifts were required, including weekend shifts and 2nd and 3rd shift. Further, even ""first shift"" (during go-lives) is a strange shift that's great for 24-hour operations (typically 6 AM - 2:30 PM) but is unnatural for people used to working first shift at the office at other IT shops.- The ""Cubicle police"": If you want to have an office in Pleasanton, watch out! You better come to the office (and badge into the building) at least 3 times per week, and you better log on to the network mostly from your office, or else you'll suddenly be declared ""100% remote"" and forced to work from home whether you want to or not. (In at least one case, they did not give the person the option to return to 100% full-time at the office.)- Lack of choice: Many low-level managers do not bother to give people the choice of what type of work they want to do, because low-level managers are mostly project-focused.- Lack of work-life balance during ""crunch"" periods: During go-lives, although they said they would keep people on the same shift throughout a week, that was ignored when they suddenly needed to fill a slot. I've had periods where I've worked day shift, night shift (the next night), day shift (second day after the night shift). I had a second shift, third shift, and first shift, all in one 5-day period. I knew another person who suddenly was needed to create some training due the next week - she was basically denied her sleep for most of a week. Management seems to think treating people this way is acceptable and does not do much to avoid this behavior.- No paid sick leave. (Unionized folks - nurses, lab personnel, and other groups, do get paid sick leave and shift differentials but non-unionized folks - most of IT - don't.)- The worst of all worlds between salaried and hourly. You are a salaried employee but you're required to report hours (for project reporting) on a technology platform called RPM. The result is management will tend to harass you if you don't report 40 hours in a week, even though you aren't paid for overtime.- Casual-ness about required travel. They think nothing about putting people on planes to help with other regions' go-lives or to go to meetings (since many groups and divisions have people across multiple divisions).- Inability to take requested vacation days during crunch periods (while other employers have claimed this ability, this is the first employer I've encountered to actively use it). Further, this denial of vacation is just based on the ""possibility"" that something may go wrong during the time period asked for, not because something has actually gone wrong and needs to be fixed.- Bureaucracy as a way of life, including unnecessary bureaucracy. For example, Kaiser employees are not allowed to buy anything on the Internet for their personal use while on the job. So, if you know you're off next weekend and want to go to a play or out camping, too bad - your counterpart at another tech firm will get the reservation or ticket, not you. There is no reason why Kaiser employees should be restricted in this way. Similarly, contractors are not allowed to send emails to most non-Kaiser addresses for security reasons. Can you say ""lack of trust""?- Cost-cutting in the employee medical plan. For example, too bad if your vision prescription changed within one year, Kaiser will only pay for glasses every two years.- A culture of hiring employees for only 2 years or less plus policies that guarantee no retirement benefits for anyone there two years or less. (There is no company match on their 403(b) - 401(k)-equivalent - plan, and their pension plan does not vest until after you've worked two years. A lot of employees are hired for ""maximum 2 years - we'll keep you if we have the work"" but they often don't have the work to keep you after 2 years.- A job/project focus, not a career focus. They have a mentoring program that has monthly phone calls, but if you use it, you're required to listen to those calls on your own time, not on the job, and the mentoring program feels like ""lip service"" in a culture that is focused on short-term getting the project completed over everything else.- FInally, it was announced last year that where-ever possible, new IT jobs would be in Colorado or Oregon, not California, for cost-cutting reasons. (I can't complain too much as I also find California to be a too-expensive place to live.)"|"- Be transparent about your actions - if you engage in a negative action, announce it and ""why"" to the employees right away. That's only ethical.- Put people concerns a little higher on the ""importance"" list. Yes, cost cutting is important, and meeting the needs of our clients/members is important, but if you don't consider the needs of employees, you will continue to pay in high turnover."|3.0

Great physicians, Average management.|Good medical benefits...best on the clinic side (TPMG, SCPMG, PMG), not so great on the hospital (KFH) side.Pay is decent for union workers and average for non-union, non-exempt workers (admins, coordinators, etc.).You have the ability to transfer between departments, facilities, and regions. There are approx. 8 regions at Kaiser serving more than 8 million members (patients). If you transfer between unions or regions, you lose seniority, but you don't lose retirement longevity (as long as there isn't an extended break in service).There is tuition reimbursement and a very small amount of forgivable loans (available to nurses). Some of the unions offer classes outside of work and there is paid educational leave for those employees.You could learn a lot about the health care field if you work here. The electronic medical record (EMR) is a really big thing right now and Kaiser is the forerunner on a lot of new practices relating to how data from the EMR is used and analyzed.People who are comfortable using technology, being open to constant change, enjoy compromise, are flexible, and willing to learn new things will thrive in the Kaiser environment.|"The management is always arguing with the physicians. They try to tell the physicians what to do, when the physicians are the ones who own the medical groups. If the staff and the physicians were left to run the clinic themselves, everything would go a lot smoother.Basically, Kaiser has too many managers. Many are overpaid and don't do much work. They are in meetings all the time and always running reports. Reports, by the way, that many of the managers don't understand and don't use to improve their business.Additionally, there are a lot of ""bad seeds"" amongst the union employees. These are people who hide behind the protection of the union. They know that management is very scared of disciplining union employees because they don't want to deal with a grievance and/or don't understand the grievance process and how to properly discipline employees. If the management team would be more active in disciplining and terminating bad employees, then the good employees could actually do more positive things in their departments and wouldn't have so much pushback from the bad employees. Then, there are the bad union employees who decide to become union reps and shop stewards. They hide behind the protection of the union and spout off all this complicated union contract language that they themselves don't even understand most of the time. Management won't even touch these employees who are union reps and shop stewards, so once again, the bad employees get rewarded, while the good employees don't get recognized for their good works.FYI, I was an employee for over twenty years before retiring. I liked my job and the doctors I worked with, but the managers came and went frequently. I miss the doctors, but am glad I don't have to deal with the managers anymore.Work here if you'd like, but be prepared to deal with the union issues and bad management structure."|Get rid of the overpaid, underperforming managers. Decrease the number of meetings and managers by at least half and you'll greatly increase your chances of being successful in the years to come.|3.0
The first ten years were a satisfying experience,the last 4 were somewhat disappointing.|Kaiser does try to promote a diverse working environment.

And be more flexible with staff work flow.|4.0

The union is too amazed at the brazenness of the supervisors to offer effective help. The new management is close to or under 30 and has no interest in listening to the ""old way"" of doing things.

Very happy working for kaiser!|Kaiser provides a wonderful service to its members having all medical services under one roof so to speak. I have found that patients are able to be treated faster and more accurately with this system. As an employee, knowing we provide a better service to our members makes for a positive outlook. Kaiser pays very well, and provides exceptional medical benefits to its FT and PT employees. There are lots of other benefits such has vacation time, sick leave, education leave that make working there even more rewarding. I have also made many many friends throughout the Kaiser network.|In my experience at Kaiser, the hardest thing to deal with has been the fact that there is hardly any accountability for employees who are not performing up to par. This is partly due to the fact that many areas are union, which makes disciplinary action difficult. This issue can be a bit of a drag for other employees, and can affect members/patients as well.||4.0
Love it! Hope to retire from here.|Great mission that builds on its roots and commitment to what's right. Financially conservative in some ways, which leads to relative job stability. People here truly care.|Management in marketing is not so great. Many poor hiring decisions at executive level have led to turnover at mid-to-senior level management level. Mid-level management misbehavior is tolerated too long without being addressed. Staff feels lack of vision, other than that we need to save money and work more efficiently.|"Give equal value to seasoned (""legacy"") folks and newer folks with varied experience.

Truly empower us and don't treat us like children with management theory cliches (this mesage to a select few)"|5.0

THRIVE is wonderful but its an ideal customer they seek rather than a culture they foster. The Thrive patient is healthy and is independently managing their health--which is great because getting more than 15 min in front of a gatekeeper Dr. is as easy to manifest as an act of God. Nice matching in 401K and retirement but you have to be there 5 years and very few people--stay the course except the ones well over 12 years in--seems they have resigned themselves.|Very politically run company. All parts work separately from HQ because of the politics and as such-- very disparate. Management is not transparent at all. They will work you to death. Do not allow or acknowledge partner family death as time for grieving nor for taking time to attend services.

You could do better Kaiser so employees can truly Thrive!|Good benefit packages for their employess. Being a Kaiser member and an employee allows for your health and medical expenses to be a lot less than those who aren't Kaiser employees.|"Immediate supervisors and mid level management were often heartless and seem to only care about productivity these days! They don't really know how their staff can be more productive nor are they able to model how to increase productivity in the time alloted for work. It is interesting that their motto is ""Thrive"" because their desire to work their employess as hard as they can to increase productivity while they strongly discourage employees from requesting overtime, even if folks have to work extra hours to complete their work, is not conducive to a ""thriving"" work environment. It doesn't seem to really matter if it is illegal to not provide overtime pay when employees are forced to work overtime because of the nature of their job. Management strongly discourages their front line staff from requesting overtime and make you feel like something is wrong with you for not being able to be more efficient and productive with your time even though more and more is expected from you in job responsibilities and duties. It saddens and angers me to know that this non-profit HMO can push their employees this hard and get away with it and still have a billion dollar surplus at the end of the year...it is no wonder that they have this much money at the end of the year given how they aren't really paying for the countless hours employees have to work overtime without pay. If you like volunteering during your typical workday this is the place for you (I'm being sarcastic!)."|"Stop being so top down in your decision-making process. Listen more to your employess and they might truly ""Thrive"" more. Let upper management know that your employees need to be paid for the many hours of unpaid overtime they put in so Kaiser members can indeed ""Thrive.""

There are growing pains related to trying to better yourself as a company, innovate, and improve, and as a forward-thinking company Kaiser employees experience that. But the general attitude is that these changes are embraced. Communication is high, which is probably why change is so accepted from the front-line up to senior leadership, and most all employees are dialed in to what is going on so that these changes don't really blindside anyone and therefore are less painful.|Maintain your course!|5.0

"The Division of Research is failing to ""thrive"" - quietly laying off 30 long term employees without severance pay."|"Opportunities to ""make a difference"" working to advance public health research, most of which is funded by NIH (National Institutes of Health) and other government grants and private foundations."|Research Associates and Assistants work very hard to make the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research successful by doing the day to day tasks required to keep mostly NIH funded public health research projects going strong. Without these workers' contributions, no data would be collected, analyzed, reported, or published in medical journals. The vast majority of these workers are not represented by Labor Unions and are paid low salaries.Many of these research projects are high profile studies that receive attention from the media and other groups within the organization. Upper management - both within the department and outside the department - likes to tout these high profile projects as great successes - feathers in their caps - achievements like no others in public heath research. This year a lavish party was thrown to celebrate fifty years of achievement in public health research and no expenses were spared. Simultaneously, thirty lower level workers were handed sixty day layoff notices without any severance pay or rehiring support, despite years of loyal service and excellent performance reviews.Upper management has created a class divide between the six figure salaries paid to administrative employees and the hard-working underpaid Research Assistants and Associates. Several administrative level employees in supervisory roles are incompetent, lack basic management skills, and have disdain for lower level workers. Bullying and defamation from people in positions of power toward lower paid workers are common experiences that have been occurring for years.

Kaiser Permanente is an inefficient company that wastes member premiums, lead by over-paid, incompetent administrators.|Most hourly positions (non-managerial) are covered under a union contract and provide decent wages and great healthcare benefits.|Incompetent management 'thrives' at Kaiser Permanente. Inefficiencies administrated by management plague many day-to-day operations who reward themselves with multi-million dollar per year salaries and numerous pension plans for themselves while simultaneously raising member's premiums significantly and working to eliminate the one employee pension plan and limiting annual raises of workers to less than yearly inflation. Administration began a yearly program in which they waste millions of dollars by sending EVERY EMPLOYEE (every year) to a 'service forum' with the stated purpose of encouraging better service to healthcare members while simultaneously short-staffing every department for several days which increases patient wait times and reduces services and/or requires departments to cancel members appointments. Following the service form, management issues corrective actions against workers for attempting to provide better service per the recommended service forum recommendations (i.e. walking patients to their scheduled appointments, conversing with patients in order to provide a more friendly healthcare environment, etc.) because this sometimes takes away time from the workers' other duties causing them to not finish work and/or work overtime. Basically, administrations SAYS they promote a positive, rewarding environment but they DO nothing to back their words up.But, it's not all management's fault; many employees have worked for this company for a lengthy period of time because of the decent wage and benefits, but morale is poor (in part due to management's attacks on meaningful wage increases and efforts to eliminate pensions, etc) but also because these workers are simply bored. These are repetitive jobs which many have performed for many years but because they are comfortable with the pay, many do not continue with school or other, constructive activities. Instead, employee-on-employee fighting is frequent (i.e. workers creating a poor work environment for each other by trying to get each other 'in trouble'). I worked at Kaiser Permanente for over 15 years but decided that was enough.If you're searching for somewhere to work that truly fosters a team/family environment, this isn't it.||1.0

Unique culture; can be good depending where you work. Avoid the Medicare LOB.|• They take development seriously, and mid-year and year-end reviews are very regimented and enforced strictly.• There are a lot of smart people who work here.|• Do not work with the Medicare line of business; the environment is toxic. They treat their internal partners horribly; make life difficult to force people to quit, publicly humiliate people in meetings, and treat vendors poorly.• Most managers manage up; it's that kind of culture. So don't expect much support from your manager, and expect to be autonomous.• There's a lack of true team cohesion. You don't really make friends here, there are no happy hours, etc. People work their eight hours and go home; it was the first job where I didn't leave having made any long-term friends. The culture seems cold and people for the most part keep their distance from each other.|Do something about the Medicare LOB; although they're a big contributor to the bottom line, they are burning people out.

Contractors Beware at Kaiser IT Pleasanton|Kaiser medical are doing amazing things. I believe that upper management are visionaries tha have plans to greatly improve the lives of its subscribers.|"Kaiser IT in Pleasanton is another story, They put 5-7 contractors in a single room, and can fit 2-3 in a closet (literally an IT closet).There is no airflow and hard to work with so much noise and distractions, Yet you are given unrealistic goals and never communicated to. Basically the ITAM program manager works full time on the East coast so you rarely see her, Worse is that she will post a job that says 6 months or 1 year and will often not honor it. This is because of poor planning and strategic direction. The Program manger relies on a few people who have their own selfish intentions to ""create issues"" and doesn't listen to the operational team. Worse I have seen her put down the operational team in many meetings. So often people on the project team have to feel like they have to ""save"" the operational team and the operational team hates that these project people come in and ask the same questions over and over. The strategy changes on a weekly basis. It's confusing and not pleasant. Projects close, open and morph about and reasons are rarely communicated to all. They have no problem humiliating contractors, making you work over 8 hours but telling you ""no one EVER claims over 8 hours a day"", putting you in a dark dingy place then cutting your contract early."|"Save hundreds of thousands of dollars. End the ITAM Project. Keep the good operational people that will ensure continuous improvement vs the ""big bang"" project approach. A year ago he project realized over 90% ROI. At this point is the ROI declining rapidly. Currents efforts right are being presented as ""Project work"". The project presence is creating an unhealthy environment. This ""over staying"" and creating unnecessary confusion and resentment to the operations teams and contractors are resentful that the project team keeps dangling the prize of ""becoming permanent"", all this does not work in the best interest of anyone.Lastly, everyday along Owens Road you'll see several smokers puffing away right under the Kaiser Permanente sign, not sure if this is the image that Kaiser wants."|1.0
Decent work life balance, limited opportunities for growth|"Depending on your department, there is a strong emphasis on work life balance.

It's imperative to develop managers who like to manage people. Part of management includes identifying opportunities for staff to grow and wanting staff to grow. A culture of ""work needs to get done, there's too much work and not enough staff"" permeates the organization, leading to an environment where despite the best of intentions, there is a culture of keeping staff in the same spot.Work is siloed - often appears to be a lot of duplication as information exchange isn't free flowing."|"Management needs to be accountable to manage and lead people.

Departments are so lean that there's not much room for advancement - you need to leave and come back to get a significant salary bump or increase in responsibility. There are so many meetings that sometimes the only time you can do your follow-up work is after hours.

The few bad ones that I noted came from unimpressive backgrounds that seemingly wanted to feel a level of control over their peers, the good thing was that I didn't find that these people were in management so you could choose to ignore them when you felt like it.The pay at Kaiser for non-exempt full-time employees is not good, but I have seen cheaper companies out there.. Non-exempt full-time non-management employees are given on average the worst remuneration in the entire company. The PTO time accumulated is normal compared to fortune 500 companies, but the sick time is horrid for non-exempt full-time employees (unionized employees are treated much better in respect to this). Because Kaiser is a health care company, people at the office often travel back and forth to the hospital.. Hospitals (as much as they'd like to proclaim their cleanliness) are known cess pools of disease. You WILL get sick here, even if you are not the type to get sick.. You WILL. It takes more than 3 months to acquire 1 day of sick time, this is definitely not enough. You will be going to work sick or using your PTO time. In other fortune 500 companies you will get 3 sick days up front plus PTO..this would be more fair. The company also sends out emails that state you must come to work..even in severe weather (huge lawsuit waiting to happen with this one..). During fire alarms, they made us go down two floors and you are told not to leave the building..there are no repercussions for exiting the building during fire alarms. Smoke was detected in the building, people went down 2 floors and waited there for atleast 30 minutes to an hour with no further notification of what was happening (this is another major lawsuit waiting to happen).The other big con here is that while a lot of companies have plenty of meetings, I feel that this place goes overboard. You will have hour long meetings over the most menial tasks.. I remember a meeting that was an hour long discussion about whether or not someone should rename a file..and in the end of the meeting it was decided to not rename the file because it wouldn't change anything for the company. A lot of the meetings here are designed to micromanage you, they will insult your intelligence by proclaiming they are not designed for the purposes of micromanagement.. Rounding every two weeks with a manager (ugh!). The manager will pretty much tell you you are always doing a good job and keep it up, they want to know the dirt.George Halvorson reminds me of the Wizard of Oz..does he crank the machine behind a curtain? I never heard or saw the guy.|Don't get too comfortable over there, there's a lot of management that's been at Kaiser for 10-20 years, do you really think you are invincible from a RIF?

Insurance Plan side management is unbelievably incompetent|"-some coworkers are really fantastic-nice folks overall-good benefits, decent pay (given the current economic conditions)-you will never NOT have enough work to do-it ""feels good"" to work for a non-profit insurer who's stated corporate values (affordable health care for all, restore the middle class, etc.) align with my own"|Management is unbelievably incompentent and reactive, I mean, it seriously defies comprehension. Many senior managers don't even have bachelors degrees, or if they do, it is a BSN. All promotion and recognition is based solely on who's ass you have kissed. Management is very checked out in general, but when a problem has spun out of control, then they swoop in and start stabbing people in the back. This creates an environment where everyone is watching their back, and spending so much time CYA-ing that there isn't time to do work. It also kills any sense of initiative. Why take the initiative when you are only going to get punished? Management tends to focus on corporate initiatives that are essentially meaningless, instead of improving the basics. IT dept is a joke. Backend systems are obsolete and do not meet operating requirements. System fixes are outsourced to India. Critical teams are severely under resourced, and at the same time, there is lots of dead wood.|Fire every incompetent and unqualified manager and hire people that are actually qualified to be managers. Better yet, promote from within. Do not hire high school graduates to manage people with advanced degrees. You do not need a ratio of 1 middle manager per 3 FTEs. If you schedule people in 6 meetings every day of the week you should not be surprised when work doesn't get done. Create a culture of accountability. Do not expect your individual contributors to work 50 to 60 hours a week when your managers barely bother to show up to work.Note: I waited until I had been working at Kaiser for over a year before posting this, to give you a fair chance, but the problems noted above were obvious to me from the first day.|3.0

An initially promising, ultimately frustrating experience.|Kaiser Permanente is definitely a company with its heart in the right place. In my tenure there, I was working on the front lines of new reform initiatives; KP is one hundred percent in support of the cause of affordable health care for all. I loved knowing this, and I loved seeing it reinforced on an almost daily basis from subject matter experts with whom I worked.|Ultimately, you don't work for a culture; you work for a person. My manager was the most disorganized person I have ever met. Her entire team, I saw after a while, seemed to exist to protect her from her own disorganization, or to dip into it as needed and take the fall for different parts of her whirlwind of disaster. The more closely I looked at corporate structures around her (she was nowhere near the service delivery side, thank God), the more of this pattern I saw: senior leaders leaning heavily on their staff for everyday support, and responding by alternately ignoring and berating them.The result in my case was a team, and larger organization, with huge things to accomplish -- but ultimately no real milestones to show for all that effort. They were always too busy putting out the senior leader's fires to ever get started on the (sometimes decade-old) things that obviously needed doing.|"Create more anonymous feedback channels from within the organization to the top.

"Kaiser is the mother of all bureaucracies. An ""old girl network"" is holding back needed reform."|"You don't have to be very good to do well here; it's nice to know that you don't have to perform at 100% every day to do well. It's actually commendable that you can have an ""off season"", maybe something in your private life is dragging you down for months, and at Kaiser it's OK. Another genuince pro is that some of the work Kaiser does, such as the Community Benefit organization, seems genuinely altruistic toward the communities Kaiser is present in and is the sort of thing more big companies should be doing."|"There are quite a lot of downsides, although none of them absolute showstoppers (so I'm still here). Kaiser is an opaque bureaucracy worse than any I've seen elsewhere, and that includes government organizations in the 3rd world. The culture reveres the idea of ""partnering"" and consensus seeking, which in practice seems to almost guarantee a lack of clear decisions or paths of escalation for problem resolution. Problems and issues don't get resolved at Kaiser, they just linger and morph and come back every year, with a slightly different twist. So there is a huge and unending amount of re-inventing the wheel here.I think top management is aware of these problems, and there are growing attempts at reform. However, much of the middle and senior management in Kaiser is dominated by a sort of ""old girls network"" and this network does not want change. They're comfortable, counting the days to retirement, and since change would take them out of their comfort zone, they steadfastly resist it.Too much of the work and budget within Program Offices is ultimately decided on the basis of personal relationships, and not on the basis of quantitative measures. Honestly I don't think a lot of the P.O. management understands common accounting measures, I know for a fact that many cannot compute a simple ROI (return on investment), which is a travesty."|There is far too much deadwood in the non-clinical side of Kaiser. The prevailing demographic is old, white, female, and mentally retired in place. Kaiser has to change its people; reforms that just reorganize the same people don't work.

There is a curious certification program akin to a kind of union environment that punishes high-achievers and rewards mediocrity. This certification program, however, is unevenly applied only to certain classes of employees namely those who are lower on the totem pole. If you happen to be a mid-level director and up you are ""MYSTERIOUSLY"" exempt. Bottom-line gripe: For some people in order to advance you must traverse their certifcation requirements for each level which translates that while mid-level folks and up HAVE no requirements outside of their normal job duties to advance and for everyone else you must not only (1) excel at your current job to a point where someone blesses you with the ""right"" to (2) satisfy their ""certification"" requirements. In KP, lack of TRUST by management toward staff is a major problem that creates a ""your on THAT side of the railroad tracks"" mentality where management preferences consultants over experienced staff. .....in fact the dirty little secret is that a lot of mid-level-and-up execs are/WERE these same consultants......so the fear about the inmates taking over the asylum makes the paternalistic control and structure of KP more understandable.

Management does not listen to staff, treats staff extremely poorly.

Management's condescending attitude really reflects the fact that morale here is low, and there is not much incentive to even try to do anything more than the bare minimum in terms of level of effort. The fact that management treats the staff so poorly and yet expects to be treated like gods is appaling. Even worse, contractors are treated like second class citizens to staff, and we lose a lot of good talent since there is a 12 month maximum rule that applies to contracted employees. The general environment and morale here is very low.

The position fuses the charge nurse role and beginning management duties, which often conflict.

I do not believe that we are treated with the same nurturing that a union employee receives. It seems as though one error in judgement can be treated as an ongoing problem.

Pretty good, secure place to work in healthcare|Kaiser Permanente is a rather large organization in CA with satellite offices in several regions throughout the US. California is the largest region and therefore the largest employer. There are many opportunities within KP to work, but finding out a career path is entirely up to you once you're in the door. There's lots to learn, management really depends on who you work for, and upper management is going through a changing of the guard.

Great people in the department I worked in; I don't know anything about the other departments, however.|-Although I was only a basic, administrative intern dealing with filing, faxing, printing, etc, the very nice, kind of hippy-ish people made it a great place to work with; I really liked interacting with them, and they very much went out of their way to make me feel welcome all the time. Then again, it is Portland, Oregon, and that's just the way it is.-As I said, I only did menial work, as expected as a first-time intern, but every time I finished a job the employees went out of their way to thank and congratulate me to the point where I was blushing; again, they are very, very nice. I can see an East-Coaster being a little uncomfortable with this kind of culture, though, because I've also worked in NYC as well and currently live in Jersey. I've heard people, especially people from NYC, freak out about Portlanders. Get used to it.-I spent a lot of time observing the culture within the department. The head of the department was very respectful towards the workers and always took their input into account, while also being firm when needed. There was minimal corporate drama, although I could plainly see two people really did not get along. But what's that in a group of great people?-They spend a LOT of time having group conferences and giving/ getting feedback and thinking about ways to innovate, do a better job, do better for clients. For some people this might be a little too much but I liked the fact they believed in their work.-Portland. Great place. I went out and took pictures during my lunch break, some of the best pictures I've taken. Lovely downtown. Nightlife too if you want, though not too much of it.|"-I was bored much of the time. Then again this is not their fault; I did not have a lot of experience, and the department had very specific jobs that I probably was not suited to handle without a lot of training on their part.-The head of the department moved to a new location. Since I constantly kept hearing from the people of the department how the department was so much better, friendlier and a great place to work due to the change in management, I suspect that it may have become less of the place I knew. However I have no knowledge in this matter, just putting it out there; the manager was integral to the department.-I can't speak badly about this location, this department, but frankly I did hear some gossip about unsatisfied employees in other departments due to bad management, etc. Also, I think a LOT of the US knows how KP messed up in California, mainly due to Michael Moore's ""Sicko."" I think they cleaned up their act some but it did nag my conscience sometimes, it's kind of embarrassing sometimes really, even though I know the OR system is so much kinder and better."|I don't know the new management and I have nothing to say.|5.0

Overall a good place to work|If you learn the rules and follow them, you will find a lot of support from the system, at least as far as maximizing benefits, balancing career/personal lives, and knowing what's expected of you.The benefits here are very good.If you have a career that includes some certification with initials at the end of your name (MD, RN, RHIT, RT, etc) then you will do well. If you are accustomed to working your way up the ladder, it's best to have some type of certification. The company is MD-centric so the closer you are to the main focus of the corporation, the better your chances for respect, advancement, wages and raises.Kaiser has many union-based positions which offer some protections for people who do not have initials at the end of their name. This helps maintain employment during times when the economy suffers and the company looks for ways to cut costs.I have met countless people with 15, 20, 25 years at Kaiser. It's not unusual - it's the norm. Although starting salaries for many positions (clerical for example) may be low, employees tend to stay a long time and work up to higher salaries through their long tenure.|"I miss being performance managed. When I'm judged based on performance, I have control of my reputation, career opportunities and future. I am in a union position and most opportunities are based on your seniority. Whether or not your input is taken seriously is based on seniority. Whether or not you have an opportunity to grow is based on seniority.Management gets away with dodging directly managing you by over-using the ""lead"" or ""senior"" positions. This prevents you from knowing what is said about you and how the manager feels about you personally or about your performance. If your ""lead"" likes/trusts/respects you, they will pass on a good report. If they don't, it's human nature that they aren't interested in your success (and may want to get even) and will not pass on a good report. You have little or no control of this. Gossip is substituted for performance management here.As with many companies, many job functions are being automated or out-sourced compared to 5-10 years ago, so if you don't have a clear medical specialty with an employment track record in that specialty, you are at risk.If you are older, you are safe if you are an MD or RN but if you are not in a designated specialty, age makes a difference in transfers and promotions.IT employees who need to purchase supplies have to do so with their own money and then request reimbursement. People who work from home likewise pay for connectivity and any related needs and then request reimbursement. I have worked elsewhere when this was billed to a company credit card or directly to the company (e.g. internet connectivity) without relying on the pocketbook of the employee to finance company business.I have worked at companies with an open-door policy. Kaiser is not like that. If you go around anyone in management to accomplish a goal, it will be remembered and you may pay for it in the long run."|I would prefer that Kaiser management work better with the union to find mutually acceptable solutions particularly when redeployment is anticipated.

Upper management is notorious for making poor decisions without consulting the people whom those decisions will affect; often they are so bad that the decisions have to be reversed because the fallout turns out to be intolerable. Middle management (mail order department in particular) creates a hostile work environment, harasses employees, berates employees for ""drinking too much water"" or ""going to the bathroom too much."" If you are not presently engaged in a conversation with a patient, you're vulnerable to being accused of not working (despite the fact that there are numerous tasks that need to be completed that do not involve conversing with patients).These are not the experiences of merely one employee, or even of a minority. Employees of the mail order department banded together and formed a petition against the department supervisor for these abuses and others (those who weren't too intimidated to add their signature)."|1.

excellent place to work with some drawbacks|excellent compensation and benefit package. Generally high level of competence and commitment in the physician group. No reward for doing procedures or surgeries, so very few unnecessary ones. Many excellent staff...but see below for issues. Electronic medical records fully in place. Nice but not lavish office and hospital furnishings. I don't like hospitals that look like 5 star hotels. I don't think it makes people less ill and it is wasteful.|Unionized employees. The poorly performing ones are protected by the Union and the excellent performers have to work harder to cover for them...a huge fairness issue.Many look at sick leave as a benefit to be taken like vacation because they have negotiated sick leave pay for the first day out, unlike other systems where sick leave doesn't engage until you have taken 1-2 days off without pay (or are paid out of your accumulated Vacation Leave) It is very difficult to fire an incompetent employee after a WAY too brief probation period.Admin management is very uninspiring. The jobs and advances are given seemingly as awards to those who toe the line and the system seems very inbred. Part of this is due to the dominance of the employee unions and the discomfort of health care administrators from other systems with this.Kaiser has the reverse situation of most competitor systems in San Diego. The physicians are for the most part compliant and under control while the staff can be surly, sulky and confrontational. It is common for patients to be treated indifferently by front desk staff. Most systems suffer from the opposite..doctors with big heads and egos that are a pain to manage and compliant staff that jump and smile when told to in order to insure that they keep their jobs.|"Our nurses and staff are very well paid compared to the Scripps and other systems. For this we should be getting exceptional support...and we are not. The strength of the unions lies in their threats to strike if they don't get what they want. What kind of a work ethic is that ? Never mind what happened to General Motors, they would rather see the ship go down than give up their job security and cush benefits, and continue rendering crummy service to patients..putting the company at risk.I realize Kaiser's ties to unions has also insured the loyalty of many other unions, thus insuring some of our patient base. But surely you can see how this circular argument also guarantees that many other potential patient sources are chased away by the effects of the union.Kaiser has had an image problem for over 50 years that it has tried very hard to overcome, with some modest success. It will never fully overcome it though until it actually solves the real problems that it has.It is possible though. I remember the days 35-40 years ago when a Toyota was called a ""death-mobile"" and was a laughed-at cheap-o Japanese toy car. How times have changed ! ! ! I'd like to see Kaiser trend away from ""General Motors"" like management and employee ethics and embrace a Toyota-like commitment to excellence and tempered union influence."|5.0

In 3 1/2 years, I applied for over 20 transfers, but was never able to change my position. However, we had 5 managers come and go during that time. Kaiser rewards mediocracy.

They do a poor job of addressing underperformance, and they're horrible at rewarding excellence.And company culture? What company culture? It's just a job.

IT workers are typical surly, unhelpful union employees, and IT policies are some of the most restrictive and actively counterproductive i have ever seen, and i AM an IT worker. work stoppage issues related to obsolescent equipment failures, obsolescent application crashes, network/firewall malfunctions, internet access/counterproductive firewall restrictions, are not frequent but constant, and are addressed very slowly if at all. and unless you're management, the telecommuting policy is frankly nonexistent.the environment, infrastructure, policies aren't even *close* to compliant with twenty-first century standards. it's a wonder anyone gets anything done at all. the only technology which functions well is the website, and that's because it's both designed and maintained out of california.do you wonder what's wrong with healthcare in this country? look no farther than Kaiser Permanente's administration. too many managers getting paid too much to push papers around their desks and finding new ways to look busy.|get real. fire the half of your buddies that are (a) functionally illiterate, (b)questionably competent, or (c) terminally lazy, and spend a month doing real work on the ground level so that you have some idea of what your respective department actually does in real life.|2.0

Kaiser: A nice place to take a nap while you do other things with your life|The work/life balance at Kaiser is much better than I've seen at other companies. The working hours are earlier than other SoCal companies -- most people are in the office by 7:30 and leave by 4:30 or 5:00. But the good part is that people are not expected to work more than 40 hours a week most weeks. Also, weekend work seems to be rare.|The organization is a matrix structure so it means that generally, most people have two or more bosses. This leads to a culture of non-accountability and one in which decisions are very, very difficult to make. The culture is extremely consensus-driven and people tend to be passive-aggressive to a fault. This is not the environment where you want to be if you like to get things done. But, if you are happy to coast for a couple of years, it can be a great place to be. People talk about getting 'Kaiserized' if you stay at KP too long: you no longer know how to function in an organization that believes in accountability.|My advice would be to look at changing the organizational structure to be less matrix-dependent. The convoluted org structure leads to complicated budgeting and planning processes that effect the organization's ability to meet goals and produce results. I certainly understand that organizational change is difficult - but it is completely necessary in this day and age. The longer they wait the more difficult it will be in the end.|1.0

Temporary workers are all dismissed. Employees who resign from jobs -- even those that that require a high degree of certification --are not being replaced. When an administrative person leaves their job, they are not replaced. Instead, their full time duties are given to another admin person who already has a full plate. This poor unfortunate person now does 80 hours of work but is paid for the same 40 hours as before. This is extremely unfair and probably illegal. In the meantime, the company continues to pay recruiters during a hiring freeze who have little to do.|Stop playing politics.

Still, it'd be appreciated to get more feedback than that."|Kaiser would be more efficient if it had more clinical pharmacists as outpatient clinic care managers (ie. primary care, diabetes clinic, PHASE, heart failure, pain, etc). We're excellent physician extenders. This is what we went to university and 4 years of pharmacy school and residency training to do.

good place to retire|benefit and work hours are good. It comes with plenty of holidays and PTO. The work culture is very layback. If you are going for a long haul, this is the place. Most people have been with the company for over 10 years. And many are waiting to receive their retirement package.|"Too much politics and autonomous organizations. Each group just cares about its territory. There is a lack of cross-functional team work. There are so much red tapes that discourage you to do any real work.

You could end up doing assembly line care.|The original model of prepaid, preventative, integrated care is worth saving; it is a mistake to dilute it just to remain competitive in a market where customers just don't want to pay for that.

Providing superior health care with great technology.|The IT work at Kaiser Permanente is extremely broad and varied. Our implementation of an Electronic Medical record is the largest non-government system in the world. Our technology is positively impacting the way health care is delivered. There are many different types of positions in IT and the ability to grow professionally is tremendous. Kaiser Permanente is located in CA, Oregon, Washington state. Washington DC, Hawaii, Colorado, Ohio and Georgia. There are many opportunities in all of these locations. Salaries are fairly good and benefits are great and include health, dental, vision, 403b and pension plan. Overall, a good place to work.|Kaiser Permanente is very large and bureaucratic. Kaiser Permanente has nearly 200,000 staff and physicians. Frequently, decision making is a long and arduous process. Dealing with the unionized staff can be difficult at times as they sometimes seem to have their own agendas and are more interested in protecting their jobs and doing as little as possible. Management staff has to frequently travel out of town for meetings at corporate headquarters.

If not, you could work 12 hours a day 7 days a week and still not complete the work.|Listen to the people in the trenches.|4.0
Great ambitions, sometimes falls short in execution; overall a rewarding place to work|Great mission, lots of opportunities, good benefits and pay, smart people. Working at Kaiser Permanente is a great way to understand the way that all aspects of health care work- insurance, care delivery, IT, internal and external communications. I believe the pay and benefits are among the best in our industry. The people I work with are some of the smartest people I have had the benefit of being surrounded by- recognized as tops in their chosen niches. I don't think a lot of people truly understand how KP is different from every other health care in the US, and how it can be a model. Externally, the old perceptions and urban legends tend to rule, and that's a shame.|"In my department work-life balance is a challenge- increasingly the demands are such that working at nights and on the weekend is expected. Having a big brand has good points, but it also results in lots of negative stories from small pockets of the organization that pull down morale. KP has a high level of bureaucracy that comes with large organizations, and the mphasis on ""influencing"" instead of being able to compel action, can make it hard to get things done. As a member as well as an employee, I also think a downside of KP is lack of good customer service and dealing with the bureaucracy as a member."|Good communications from top management about the business|4.0
Kaiser is always reinventing for the future|"It can give great job security over the years of service. Depending on the department you work for, there can be a sense of ""family"" with working with the same employees and staff. Also if you move to a different city there is the advantage of transfering to another Kaiser, and not losing your senority. They can also offer great medical and dental benefits in this day and age so important."|"Over the years rumors of layoffs or changes seem to always get ""leaked"" before the official word from management, which is unsettling to those involved. Sometimes changes are made in departments or management that aren't always thought out and end up being changed multiple times during the process. Sometimes upper management loses touch with the front line worker and what is really needed to make things work in the proper setting. Just having a MBA, PHD or years of schooling doesn't mean you actually know how to do a job unless you actually ""do the job"" and can understand the challenges the effected faces in that situation."|read my downsides.|4.0

Not bad|You get very comprehensive and affordable medical & dental benefits. You also get excellent disability and life insurance for a very low cost. Pharmacists are paid a competitive salary and are enrolled in the pension plan which is calculated as:Final monthy compensation x 1.5% x years of service. (This amount is pad to you on a monthly basis upon retirement) You can cash this in at age 55 if you have had atleast 15 years of service, or at age 65 after 5 years of service or if age + years of service equals 70.After 5 years the employer will contribute the equivalent of 5% of your salary to a etirement fund. You can also contribute up to $15,500 a year pretax into a retirement fund. Depending on how well the company does during the year pharmacists may also recieve a year end bonus which can be up to 3% of there salary; (although this year we recieved nothing.)|I'm not happy with the meica insurance.

Don't bank on career advancement possibilities within KP-IT|I gotta admit, I got in to my current job with KP-IT because I knew someone in management in KP-IT. It beats being a contractor. Right now, with this recession and all, having a job that is salaried+benefits is GOLDEN, if you ask me. I think I am getting paid pretty well, considering. If I had to pick the best thing about KP to work for them, it has to be the people I work with.. shoot, even the people I don't work with on a dialy basis are really nice (with the occasional rare exception). I have made several friends since working for Kaiser; and in the I.T. world, having professional contacts is very good to have, especially if you decide later you want to move on to a job in another department, or even leave KP altogether. Having a good work environment co-worker-wise makes the day a lot easier to get through.|Working in KP-IT has definately been interesting, however it seems like every time there is a budget cutback or 'hiring freeze', the first thing to get put on hold is any kind of Kaiser-paid-for training. When I worked support for a past employer as a salaried employee, we got to go to one company-paid training even each year. Since I have been with KP-IT I have been to one KP-paid training event, PERIOD. It would be nice if they invested a little bit more in us; the cost of an outside training event most certainly can be written off as a business expense, I suspect, so I don't see what the hold up is..|Make sure that everyone gets a shot at their periodic and annual reviews. Example: This is the beginning of Feb 2009 and lets just say that I know quite a few people that haven't had their annual reviews yet. Also, make sure everyone is given a chance to be asked if they would like to take some kind of additional training, whether it be for their current job role, or for if someone is looking to train for a different job role in a different department or location. Employees tend to feel 'boxed in' if they aren't learning anything at their current position, and don't get the impression that there is a chance to advance and/or get promoted in their curent job role. That usually results at that employee deciding to start looking for a job somewhere else.|3.0
medicine the way we all want it to be practiced|At Kaiser evidence based medicine is performed. When treatment decisions are made it is done by doctors who are operating for the interests of the patient. When decisions are made regarding formulary and machinery to equip the department it is made by the physicians after a careful review of the pro's and cons of each decision. When operating decisions are made in this manner, the loyalty to the department, organization, professional and job satisfaction are tremendous. For a physician there are many motivations when choosing where to work. Kaiser allows the physician to work in an environment where we are paid adequately however, the professional job satisfaction and end resultallows us to perform our craft the way it should be done.

Like all large organizations, the genuine commitments of leadership are sometimes lost in translation farther down the line. KP operates in a challenging environment - the state of healthcare in the U.S. As a non-profit there is not quite as much flexibility to make quick operational changes as with nimble for profit organizations. All healthcare organizations struggle with recruiting and retaining highly trained individuals given that health care has not been as popular a career path for many young people as other fields in recent years. That means that while some people are great, others are less so. On the other hand, I don't think that is so different from other similar institutions, with the exception perhaps, of hospitals closely tied to medical schools. Finally, whether in healthcare or any other business, everyone is trying to do more with less, so there is definitely stress.|Keep it going - we're on the right path.

An excellent, stable non-profit Health care employer seeks passionate, knowledgeable professionals for mutual benefit|Company has an excellent corporate mission, is fair to employees and has an ambitious IT agenda.

Kaiser - The Handcuffs are Golden|I work in Mental Health. The salary is one of the best in the social services, behavioral health industry. Benefits are good and our jobs are protected by SEIU-UHW West union membership, which isn't too common in mental health. Kaiser employees have strong job security, the average employee at Kaiser stays for more than 20 years. In my field we are also supported by Kaiser and the union to continue our education through paid education days and free classes sponsored by the union and Kaiser, which helps for those who are licensed. Vacation benefits start out at 24 days a year, our entire family is covered by Kaiser medical insurance at no cost to the employee, we have a good 401K that Kaiser contributes to after two years of employment - 1.25% of our annual compensation, as well as a retirement pension. Part-time employees also receive benefits and they are flexible with work hours in mental health - 4/10 work weeks or other configurations. If you want to work in mental health, learn more, grow as a professional, Kaiser presents a great opportunity for this.|The work load at Kaiser can be overwhelming at times, their desire is that every hour of the day be filled with a patient, which can be very draining in mental health. Communication between departments isn't efficient and frequently, although we can be interdependent, we don't really know what the other department does specifically, or how they function, and vice versa. Also, much of the job satisfaction for staff in behavioral health is connected to the style of management in their clinic, which varies from caring and supportive to indifferent and neglectful. This is a problem across the board within Kaiser. My experience of Kaiser management, senior and line, is that they are generally polite and respectful. Nevertheless, it is easy to get typed at Kaiser which will determine future opportunities or lack thereof.|Be more authentic in your dealings with the at-times-overworked staff, work jointly to improve job satisfaction with real compromise and consideration of new ideas.|5.0
KP Review|"The mission of the organization is by far the best reason to work for KP. We are the solution for health care in the United States. Typically employees ""get along"" and because of this KP is a very pleasant work place. Work/Life balance is also very good and is emphasized by management. The idea of the Labor Management Partnership and UBT's is also very forward thinking and could be a model for employee/labor relations in the future if it is implemented correctly."|It takes forever sometimes to make a decision- because of lots of red tape and the fact that KP is a consensus based culture.|Take steps to become a more efficient and nimble organization. Do not try to follow competitors- constantly push the leading edge. Just because our competitors are going to higher cost sharing products that does not mean that we need to. We need to simply provide the best possible value and quality and growth will follow. Cull out those in Senior, Labor and Middle management/leadership who are holding up the realization of LMP and UBT's.|4.0
Great place to work hard, if you don't mind large bureaucracy that is centered around physicians.|The care providers, both physicians and non-physicians, really care about their patients and the quality of care they provide. In general, they are smart, well-trained, and keep up with new developments in their field. The medical care providers are often doing some of the best research in their field, helping to keep the quality of services very high. Not the cutting (sometimes bleeding!) edge that you might find at major academic medical centers (eg, the UC's or Stanford), but in the top 10% of what you'll find anywhere (including those major medical centers). And just like the old advertisements used to say, there really are good people at KP. It's been great for my professional development.Compared to some corporate environments, and other medical settings, that I'm familiar with, it's my choice for employment by far.|"There is a weird ""entitlement"" factor associated with the Kaiser culture, both among certain employees and a lot of members. Maybe it's just part of the American culture at large. Some employees seem not to understand that KP is a business, not a social service organization, and don't take personal responsibility for making it a good place to work and a good place to get health care services. They talk about ""Kaiser"" as though it was the Great and Powerful Oz (the wizard), some nameless, faceless, uncaring entity trying to exploit them and which, in turn, should be exploited. They don't understand that it's a highly competitive world, and to continue to get good pay and great benefits, they and the company they work for have to succeed in that competitive environment. Likewise, some members have similar misconceptions, and want the latest, most costly drugs, tests, and other services, even when there is no evidence those are any better than what has been established, and they want these things at below cost. They don't see a relationship between their premiums (mine too) and the cost of these services. That's one problem with prepaid healthcare.The other big thing for me personally is the discrepancy between the pay and benefits for the MDs vs other providers and people who work alongside them. In fairness, those physicians usually work extremely hard, especially in primary care, but sometimes it seems outrageous what they get that others don't. And the culture is very physician-centric. Some argue that is a strength of KP, as compared to healthcare systems that are run by business people, but that physician-centeredness is often exclusive, just a different version of an 'old boys network' that can cause undercurrents of resentment among others in the organization. And the bureaucracy - yikes! A lot of it has to do with the incredible amount of regulation that healthcare organizations have to deal with, but still, it is slow and cumbersome."|Continue to work on internal communication about the vision, the methods, and the goals of the organization. Don't sugar coat things, so that communication loses credibility and just sounds like cheer-leading. Find ways to walk around and visit the non-MDs at the medical centers. (I am commenting about the TPMG leadership in northern California, more than the national organization of which Mr. Halvorson is CEO.)|4.0
Long term employer|Positive work environment. Good growth opportunities. Great PTO system and benefits.

Kaiser Permanente is also a leader in innovation through our on-line medical records and research. It makes you proud to work for a company that is stepping out as leaders in our country.|Too much work. Trying to keep costs down means fewer employees do more work. I also feel that Kaiser embraces a little too much diversity by crossing ethical lines. I'm all for gender and cultural diversity. I do not support flaunting gay rights - meaning that I'm very tolerant of working alongside gay people but calling out they they are gay and giving them special recognition isn't good.|Apply work life balance to yourselves and to employees - not just to members.|4.0
Organization establishing itself as industry leader|"The leadership of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan is aggressively working towards advancing the reputation of the overall organization. KP's unique organizational structure has proven to be an effective solution in providing cost efficient healthcare in the long history and evolution of the industry. The organization is in an active phase of reinventing itself in all aspects by stimulating creativity and the freedom to ""think outside of the box"". The opportunities are significant to leverage KP's strengthes in the market place, thrusting it as a forerunner in the race to solve the nation's healthcare problems. Evidence of the continued evolution of KP's Health Plan proves that it is right on target with the rest of the organization to awaken the industry, the public and even the government as being an effective solution in today's healthcare crisis."|"Change in culture needs to continue embracing new, fresh perspectives and not get so bogged down with historical ways of doing business. New blood continues to be infused throughout the organization with positive results surfacing everyday. Resistance to change is diminishing. New leadership is infusing a mindset towards openness and creativity. However, ""politicing"" still continues to damper forward progress in the reengineering process of a new culture. Slow but sure evidence is pointing to the rewards of testing new ideas both tactical and strategical. The well established organization is very large and it will take time for the changes in culture to permiate across all discipline boundaries."|Promote & leverage unique organization structure as successful market solution for providing the most cost efficient accessable healthcare and a very rewarding place for career growth, advancement and job satisfaction.|5.0

Thrive Elsewhere...|When you ask employees during the interview process and they tell you Kaiser is different..you better believe it.

The process at Kaiser is more important than it's people. Consultants are treated better than FTE's, have more rights, get more perks..If you're a consultant at Kaiser..you'll thrive.

Great Job to Have When Going to School for a Career|The benefits! Kaiser has some of the best benefits available. Where else can you get a free MRI or a $5 surgery. The pay is pretty amazing as well.

Kaiser Permanente is a GREAT PLACE TO WORK!|KP is full of passionate people interested in making a difference. There are many opportunities here, and just like anywhere else, contacts within the organization make a huge difference.The benefits are fabulous - Health, Dental, Vision, 401(k), Pension, etc. Time off is ok (3 weeks to start at my level and I'd prefer MORE). Management expectations for work/life balance is reasonable.It is very hard to get a job at KP from the outside (cold) without having contracted their previously.My co-workers are intelligent, motivated, and technically competent people.

I have received nothing but excelent reviews and taken on more work than I was hired to do, but the promotion that I was promised never came.

KP|I think Kaiser Permanente offers so many oppurtunities for growth. That is one of the main reasons why I wanted to become a part of this company. I think the pay is decent compared to other companies. And the benefits are much better than other companies. No other company offers the type of benefits that we are offered through Kaiser. There are so many benefits outside of the job with your personal life in addition to the ones that have to do with employment. And no other job takes so much consideration with an individuals seniority at the job place.|I think the company is not strict enough with the attendance policy. I have held three positions at Kaiser and at all three of these locations, the attendance remains to be below standards. People take advantage of the sick time and vacation time that we are offered. And not to forget about the life balance time. I have never worked anywhere where it is okay for people to call off from work so much and come late and stil have a job without at least getting in trouble for it. I guess it has a lot to do with the union.|I think senior management should pay a little more attention to the number one issue with Kaiser employees, which is attendance.|4.0

You create a project proposal but never get any feedback on it therefore you don't know how to proceed. They ask you to do things without thinking it through first.

Kaiser good for benefits|The benefits are really good for those who have families. It doesn't cost anything to insure yourself and your family and the copays are only 25 dollars I think. IF you and your spouse work for Kaiser then you have 'dual coverage' which means that you don't pay anything for medications and doctors visits. This makes healthcare for a Kaiser family very very very very cheap. They have a lot of hospitals around the inland Emprire and the Los Angeles area.

It's hard to leave the benefits and job security that are a key component of this organization.|I am very proud to be associated with Kaiser Permanente for it's model of preventive and integrated health care. There is a strong focus on improving the quality of care provided, and there is a lot of research that has drawn national, and sometimes, international attention. Community service is emphasized and encouraged, and it is expected that employees will give back to the community in terms of time or efforts. There are policies in place to allow employees to take time off to go participate in humanitarian or military service without any negative impact to their career. In addition, the benefits are very good, with a significant amount of vacation time, pension, and insurance benefits. Finally, due to the size of the organization, there are often job opportunities throughout the region, allowing flexibility if needed.|Some of the concerns that I see are a top-down management style in which the senior-level leadership seems disconnected from what is occurring at a facility level. There are alway multiple initiatives being rolled out, and it can come across as reactive rather than well-planned. As a result, it is often difficult to see sustained culture change. There are also a myriad of meetings, which often prevent the managers from being able to support front-line staff and do the daily work expected. Work-life balance is not encouraged, and there is frequent turnover at a management level. In addition, the union contracts are structured to provide the maximum benefit and little ability to reward excellent performance. As a manager, my experience has been that there is very little support for dealing with performance-related issues.|I would like to see more support for management, as there is sometimes a feeling of entitlement on the part of the union partners that gets in the way of the overall performance of the organization. When the partnership works well, it's great, but, more often than not, it appears to be a partnership in name only. In addition, there are a lot of consultants with not enough focus on core staffing to do the work required at a facility level. With all of the focus on rolling out the new medical centers and computerized medical records, it seems that the money could be better spent on providing direct services to members. Finally, it also seems like the organization could do a better job of billing for services rendered, which would assist with the overall financial performance of the organization.|3.0
You can get a job for life, but you won't be thriving!|Kaiser has great benefits, especially generous paid time off (vacation) and, depending on your location and union (if any), generous retirement plan. Also, judging from the incompetent idiots I work with, it appears that once you manage to actually land yourself a job you are pretty much guaranteed a job for life. I've never seen anyone fired, and that includes the incompetent f***-ups.|"Kaiser treats their employees miserably. They have little sense of a proper work-life balance (their ""Thrive"" commercials are just a bunch of feel-good propaganda, if one judges by how they treat their paid staff). Also, if you are a performer and not a slacker, working at Kaiser can be kind of demoralizing when you see that the slackers never get reprimanded for their lack of ability or participation in the total work effort, and they get the same annual review rating and salary bump that you, the always achieving super performer, get."|Treat your employees more kindly and more equitably.

HMO and Big Business, one in the same.|Kaiser Permanente is a good company to learn about how large scale entities work. Multiple hospitals are managed and jobs are classified as a facility, regional, or national level due to the large scope of the management. After maybe about 6 months, you begin to see where you fit in the puzzle of things, since projects around here tend to move at snail pace (as with any large scale company). You'll be proud to identify yourself as working for a company that is highly visible to the community. That benefits package is top-notch, but expected of a healthcare profession. The ETO policy is not too shaggy either starting you at 21 days per year.|It's a hit or miss on whether you find your middle management competent and worth your attention. Many disgruntled employees roam the halls because of mismanagement and misguided attention. Well....what's new anyway, that can be seen mostly anywhere, but here it's also prevalent. The way that information is passed down from upper management can also be seen as a mystery to employees lower on the totem pole. At the bottom, you would see many employees just happy to be employed and earning a paycheck, caring less about work, and more about what is going on after work. And now the select few who are allowed to sit in with the big dogs, and get a taste of project management. After about 5 years of this, you can now consider yourself Kaiserized at this point. Most people at this company work outside of their job titles. At the same time, some people barely satisfy it, yet they still have the same job title as YOU do.|I would like to see a more thorough review of how information is passed from the top. The standard employee orientation does not introduce you to the way to become Kaiserized. Department structure is very important for employees that are achievers.

Kaiser is a decent place to work, nothing more, nothing less.|Definitely, the biggest reason why people want to be employed by Kaiser is th benefits package. As an employee, healthcare is completely covered with only a $5 copay for any visit. That can't be beat by any company.|At Pasadena regional offices, on the Health Plan side, the work is very boring and monotonous. Unless one has that Sales/Marketing driven ego, the Health Plan side is not the place to be. It's irritating how these depts only concentrate on bringing in membership, then think that their job is done once people enroll in the health plan. That is Kaiser's achilles heel - the mindset that members are just numbers to accumulate toward a big bonus payout. On the other hand, the clinical side of the house, the Medical Group, this is the side that concentrates efforts on patient care. It too has it's ridiculous executive and middle managers, but at least it's humanity is on display by focusing on the actual health of patients. This is the side that tries to prevent members from leaving for other health plans. No one side is perfect, but if I were giving advice on which half is the better employer, my money would be on the Medical Group side.|"Stop hiring unqualified, inexperienced people in roles of managing staff. For example, just because one completes an MBA residency at UCLA, at 25 years old, these people have no idea how to manage their own work let alone the work of others. There are plenty of inhouse seasoned professionals who are much more qualified, absolutely more knowledgeable, and much more respected by others who could do the job better.Also, senior management needs to get off their high horse and stop thinking and taking advantage of the system. When they take vacations, they don't claim it on their virtual time cards as ""time-off."" They get to ""work from home,"" but expect staff to be at the office all day long. Everyone knows that most managers really aren't working on business-related things from home. It's another tactic they use to get free vacation time, while the rest of the employee population are being honest about their paid time-off.

Not living up to the potential|"There are many opportunities to improve the health care delivery system at Kaiser. The organization - and this refers to the ""corporate"" functions - is well aligned around the importance of delivery of care, and improved health outcomes, to all patients.It can be really great to feel part of such an important mission, and to see the potential for a working model of health care delivery that is better aligned in its incentives than most of the industry in the U.S.Retirement benefits are excellent, if one stays for at least 5 years. (Kaiser still has a defined benefit plan, in addition to a 403(b).) At some point (maybe at 10 years?), a retiree gets health care coverage for life!"|"Most of the ""corporate"" executives have learned that they need to self-promote and protect their own interests in this highly-political environment.When moving beyond areas that directly affect the delivery of care, the politics of self-interest and turf seem to take over. It can be extremely difficult to get the right things done for Kaiser Permanente as a whole, because one must balance the frequently competing interests of the individual executives.Because of the longevity of Kaiser (over 50 years) and the traditions behind that, as well as the political climate, change is difficult to make happen - even when there are really compelling reasons for it."|Take a really hard look at how executives are rewarded and promoted. Try to get their incentives aligned to the good of Kaiser Permanente as a whole, not just their individual piece/department - and insist on more teamwork & collaboration in areas that can & should better support the delivery of care and wellness programs, more cost-effectively, and to more patients.|2.0
A dystopia of mediocrity with great perks|The vacation benefits here rapidly accumulated while I was there at like a day and a half a month. Its easy to schedule in the time you want off and this doesn't account for the personal and sick days. With all factored in its possible to take 5 weeks off a year. The health benefits are practically free. Scheduling the checkups can be done through the member website without a phone call. Socially, the large employee base makes it easy to find friends and the diversity within the organization is world-class. Also, working here is different from a typical agency where deadlines are back-to-back as projects generally have fairly long release cycles.|"The good things about working here can be a double-edged sword. Interpersonal relationships and friendships sometimes get in the way of a project progressing. The time allocated for most projects helps to smooth over this issue by making plenty of slack for lack of productivity caused by ""people"" problems. Most solutions to organization and communication problems are solved by very round-about indirect means (kludge) by management which married the organization to the kludges of past as time went on. So after a year or two a ""solution"" would require its own set of resources full-time. It is frustrating for a detailed person who is keen on progress and communication to overlook this for an extended period of time."|Improve communication within the organization and flatten it out. Provide a means for change to be initiated by anyone and gain momentum by merit and interest. It was too easy for self-interested ones to stifle good change.

Great benefits, totally backwards company.|Benefits are unlike anything you may find anywhere else. Health plan and dental benefits for employee and family are pretty much paid for with only a $5 or $10 copay for most plans.Paid time off builds very quickly and can build to up to 500 hours in Northern California, and no maximum in Southern CA. Considering all time off benefits available, most employees have at least 20 days off available during the first year.If an employee loses their job through restructuring, they are given between 90 days and a year notice to find another job and generous severance benefits if they don't find a job. There are a lot of company resources available at anytime.Kaiser is one of the last employers to offer a pension plan, so if you work there for five years, you have guaranteed retirement compensation. If you work for fifteen years, you have guaranteed retirement health plan coverage. So, it's really the benefits that keep most people there.Also, most hourly jobs are union jobs, so there is a lot of job security for most hourly staff.There is a social mission at Kaiser that doesn't often exist at other health care providers that motivates a lot of people who work there.|"It is impossible to get much of anything done, and can be incredibly frustrating for anyone who wants to feel accomplishment from their work. What might take a week in another company may take six months at Kaiser. This is the rate of progress at KP. Things that most companies were doing in the 1980s are seen as revolutionary at KP today.It's decentralized into a bunch of separate fiefdoms, most of which rarely talk to one another, so you may find that there are twenty people with the same job title all doing the same work, none of whom know that they are all duplicating efforts.Systems and work processes are so antiquated that it's laughable.The executive employees are set off from the rest of the organization and often have no sense (or often interest) in what is happening below the executive level. There is a lot of jargon and happytalk all the time, but very little action. This leads to a general lack of trust in management, and a general sense that employee concerns will not be addressed. As a result, there is a lot of underlying anxiety and fear in the employee base which is not openly expressed.There is also a strong impression that poor performance by employees is overlooked, and that managers don't like conflict, so do not address performance issues. This hurts good employees and drags everyone down.Kaiser also tends to throw people at problems. More people end up involved in what should be simple tasks. Hiring someone else is often the solution to whatever the problem might be, when the real problem is often that the people on staff aren't doing what needs to be done.Kaiser is known as a ""B""or ""C"" company. It's a place people go to retire, rather than to grow in their careers. This is sad, because it could be a great place to work.Some of the stuff that happens day to day is enough to make one pull one's hair out.

Great Place to Work - Back Again, Thriving, and Staying!|"Kaiser has work-life balance! I have time to do a good job and think so that I make good decisions. I can do a quality job. What may look like red-tape and slow work is actually ""Doing it right the first time, so you don't have a second time"". For us, lives are on the line, so we have to concentrate on providing quality not quantity. So, while my work is in project management, defining a governance process, and helping a large group of the best professionals in medicine to work within a process; I still have to concentrate on making sure that everything I do helps KFHP to be the best provider of health care in the business.

You don't have much in the way of mentors because everyone is up to their ears in alligators (LOTS of work!). But that can be it's own pleasure, if you know how to handle it. I think Kaiser could provide a little more help to employees in that arena. Also, it's hard to gain credibility when your users and colleagues are all MD's and RN's. Their world is very bound in titles. So, it's hard to prove your worth to them. Then again, it is also the coolest job in the world when everyone around you is so bright. Yes, the pay is a little bit less than the outside, but between the wonderful people I work with, the great environment, and the benefits, it's worth it! All in all, for me, the downsides can be spun in my mind into opportunities - so I don't have a lot of complaints.|Don't forget to listen to the rank and file.

Everyone has job security (Kaiser rarely fires anyone) with lots and lots of very old dead wood. I suspect many people were promoted to positions of moderate authority (Directors and under) simply out of seniority, because they seem to have no appreciable skills or knowledge. It's also extremely slow-moving. Something can be a ""high-priority"" project, and no one will have time for a 30 minute conference call for 2 weeks -- and this is acceptable. Finally, no one can make a decision, as there appears to be an endless cloud of stakeholders, policies, regulations, and everything else that will make it impossible for anyone trying to accomplishing something to push forward. Also, the stated policy from senior management is that everyone is essentially the same in terms of performance. You have to save the world in order to be considered above average.

They definitely know their pecking orders. If an Indian IT Director says jump the Sr. Indian Managers would say how high and then in turn he tells his reporting Indian manager to jump x number of feet and he would in turn tell the rank and file engineers to jump x number of feet.

That means you are expected to do 60 hour work weeks for months at a time with no time off (and your comp times you are expected to carry your cell phones) to complete your tasks.These are not managers with ""your"" career goals in their best interest. They are concern with looking good in front of their customers/stakeholders so they too can become Directors and Sr managers. Mangers will say one thing to you and turn around say something else to the stakeholders to make themselves look good. If you are on the team and make a mistake with the stakeholders there is no way they will step up to protect you the employee. They will literally hang you out to dry just to ensure your mistake does not make them look bad and stall their career advancement. These managers are very political and they are very good at playing the political game and they know what it takes to ensure you don't make them look bad.Probably not all of KPIT is like this but in this IT department in Pleasanton that was what I observed and experienced for 2 years. If you get an offer with KPIT in Pleasanton I would highly recommend speaking with the sw engineers and support engineers to understand what the working environment is all about. Once a week you are expected to work a 12 hour shift doing support (they don't ever tell you this during your interview. They also do not tell you that your are expected to be available 7x24 either). Don't get fool with the KPIT recruiter and recruiting web site presenting the job description as the best thing for your career. Do not make the same mistake I made!"|"Take a look at your middle managers and see how they are treating their employees. The picture your middle managers are presenting you are not always what it seems. Please take some management training in how to become an effective manager. If you know what ""skip levels"" are this would be an opportunity to listen and hear from your employees."|1.0

Overall review|This company has excellent health care, mental health, and flexible spending account benefits. Their vacation time increases with every year you are here. Pay is above average and retirement pension and benefits are, too. The people here tend to be happy to be here. Right away I felt like part of a team.

They even have some little perks, too.|It is still a corporation that worries about the bottom line, and you are reminded of that a lot, but it is not oppressive.

Sweatshop for Doctors|- Excellent retirement package if you stay 10+ years working 100% full time- Flexible scheduling for time off, coverage by other colleagues- Compensation is very good and competitive- Sturdy EMR and easy consultation structure.- Incredible growth and marketshare thanks to an ever apparent corporat-ization of American health care so that literally it is run like a business. (which I am not arguing should be the case but no one ever expects a clinic to be run like General Motors.)|"- Literally a sweatshop if you are a primary care MD doing majority primary care patient time.- You are pushed into a situation of every 15/20 min appointments with a mixture of either patients who are really sick and need 40 mins of time or ""worried well"" healthy patient who are psychologically imbalanced and obsessed with inane and irrelevant issues who also take 30-40 of your time. As a results you are always behind. (I am an extremely efficient person so time management problems are usually not a problem for me)- Kaiser's business model is to enroll and take over the marketshare for healthy young patients, show them how ""cool"" Kaiser is with instant e-mails and fast consults so that they never want to leave, keep them healthy and phase out the sick folks.- As a result tons of new and healthy young patients without problems except it self selects for young patients who are a tiny bit insane who come in with a list of complaints and demands that are not medically significant, but they want care at that moment, and they demand an MRI, CT, blood tests, without any regard to your medical opinion or expertise. Then it is your job as a physician to explain to them why they should not be ordered etc, they get mad, you lose, and so you order the tests, then a few months later you get a report of your superiors detailing the unnecessary tests you ordered, if significant enough your bonus is withheld and you are punished.- contrary to common belief there is a punitive system of punishing doctors for unecessary testing. It is not done at the front end (which is good) so there is some autonomy, no preapproval nonsense) but after awhile you are forced to change the way you practice because you can be sent for remediation education, and financial withholding of your bonus checks. You are warned of this by middle management (at least they whisper this to you)- Doctors who have been there for awhile and with political ambitions are promoted to higher positions of power, awarded with less patient time, and higher salaries and therefore are sorely out of touch with the frontline doctors trying to keep their head above water to take care of the droves of patients coming through their doors.- Leadership is not composed of primary care MD's (the heart and majority of the KP workforce), Leader CEO Robbie Pearl, a non practicing plastic surgeon, is credited with saving Kaiser(and he did) but he is no longer a doctor, literally he is the Jack Welsh (General Electric) of Kaiser. Legendary in status but now completely out of touch with his workers and spitting out initiatives that are ineffective to making primary care more bearable but still making tons of money for the company. Therefore no problem is perceived when a company still makes a profit.- You are constantly monitored. Because Kaiser's IT is so advanced every aspect of your practice from the second you ""open"" a chart to when you ""close"" a chart, how much time you spend with a patient, how many labs you order, how many clicks you click, how fast or slow you return patient e-mails is logged and reviewed by higher management and interpreted without the scientific standards we learned in medical school. Instead it is analyzed by MBAs or executive MD's pretending that they have an MBA."|"- Honestly 1/2 the people that work in my unit are administrators in one form or another. They are Lead MD of this..., Assistant Chief of that..., Champion of this..., Chief of that....- As a result they are ""awarded"" with less patient time and the MDs that work with patients exclusively are holding the bag and bearing the brunt of the work.- There is way too much ineffective leadership at the lower levels and at the higher levels as well.- At the executive office there are probably 50-75 Medical Doctors who have not touched a patient in years and sit in an ivory tower telling other doctors that they should see more patients.- The Kaiser corporate illusion will be exposed one day and patients will revolt, just as easy as Kaiser recruited those patients, they will leave in disgust when they see the sweatshop conditions that compromise their care.- Install primary care leadership.- Discourage career executive MD's - you cannot have this classic business model and expect it to work the same as a fortune 500 company. It is almost an insult to see an MD at such a high level and still be so insensitive to MD needs.- Make administrator MDs feel the pain frontline primary care MD's go through everyday - that will change their executive decisions for sure.- make promotion and pay raises more transparent.- focus on quality patient care not marketshare and profits."|2.0

If you are just a plain vanilla- raised in America of polyglot European extraction lacking an extra x chromosome you can end up feeling like you lack a certain type of cultural/gender mojo.New hires tend to get taken advantage of (i.e. have extra work surreptitiously pawned off on them) because it takes years to become aware of all the little arcane scheduling rules etc and also years to realize that at Kaiser saying no to something you don't want to do is usually ok if you are otherwise a valued employee.Many physicians are hired into the management ranks (mostly xx chromosomes with kids who enjoy the flexibility there admin hours provide) and in general physicians make very poor and expensive managers (i.e. society paid usually hundreds of thousands of dollars to educate someone to be a physician and then they end up doing vacation schedules) because they tend to be both competitive and defensive; not by nature but by way of the acculturation process by which one becomes a practicing physician.Ancillary staff is all unionized and that is a very different environment then most physicians practice in. The typical status hierarchies are upended. As a physician at Kaiser you can be fired but once past the probation period a union employee has to do something like steal from the company before they can be let go; being unable or unwilling to do your job is not enough. If you are a low status specialty (primary care) then you almost certainly will have one of these employees foisted on your department because the surgeons don't have to put up with it. You will have to bow and scrape to these incompetents because to do otherwise is suicide-remember they can be written up for being on their cell phone constantly but they can't be fired. So you will find yourself saying things like gosh I can see your busy (medical assistant on cell phone) but I was wondering if you could do x for Mrs. Y.Primary care has devolved into managing cholesterol levels and hemoglobin A1Cs and other health maintenance tests because Kaiser is very intent on having the best HEDIS scores. This emphasis tends to attenuate other general practice medical skills like lancing a boil (often referred to surgery) or examining a knee (immediate referral to ortho).|If you could find away to get rid of the union Kaiser would probably be unstoppable. I applaud the values and inclinations that lead to trying to work with a union, but it leads to so many maladaptive behaviors on the part of ancillary employees and the retention of employees who are clearly incompetent that it is really self destructive of Kaiser to continue affiliating with the union.|4.0

Wonderful co-workers and interesting work....|The part of working at Kaiser? Many of the finest coworkers that I've had the privilege to work with in my 30 years of work.

Not a bad workplace; leadership needs to connect better with workforce|KP is uniquely positioned in the health care industry as both a provider and insurer, and with health care reform in progress, it is interesting to have an insider's view of a major health care company's actions and reactions in this period of transition. While there are a lot of interesting projects going on throughout the company's administrative departments, as well as in the health care realm, and teams are very busy keeping up with various initiatives and trying to master a constantly changing environment, KP management seems to be very committed to preserving a work-life balance.|Leadership often opts to keep its distance from the details of the day-to-day work, problems, and obstacles of those tasked with getting the work done.

Kaiser Permanente - the lumbering giant with the good heart that bumbles along with a periodic murmur......|"It's weaknesses are its strengths..........incredibly complex matrix-style management.

Total disconnect between senior management and the nurses at bedside. Scheduling is not as flexible as it is at other hospitals. There are a ton of nurse educators on the payroll, but their training is subpar at best; most of my inservices consist of me skimming over a sheet of paper and then signing my name to a form.|Kaiser nursing feels old. You've done a lot of recruiting at nursing schools, but you don't do enough to keep good young nurses satisfied. Why is such a large proportion of your staff from overseas?

So close but so far....|Kaiser will the around for the long haul. It has incredible potential to be the deliverer of the nation's single-payer-health plan. I believe in its future.You can transfer to a huge variety of other departments, regions and states. The schedules offered in a 24 hour facility can be exceedingly convenient. The benefits are worthy and it is precisely why I work here.|It seems that typical management prefers the ant-on-a-treadmill worker rather than the person who thinks about what they do, notes trends in errors and suggests how to make the work flow more efficient. You may not be well received if you speak up. I have witnessed too many instances of continued methodology which makes my department look good at the expense of the next department up the food chain. The larger the organization the larger the disorganization. I am sorry I am unable to help Kaiser improve efficiency.The Union is a double edged sword. Yes, it offers security, but it also shields those who are unworthy of it. Managers do not read(or abide) by the Union Contract unless a worker takes the contract and literally points to the paragraph in question. Combative stance with your co-worker(and your boss is a co-worker) is a bad stance. Nor does the Union support the direct language printed in black and white within the contract if they choose (with a wink from Kaiser management) to not do so. There is no where to go when this happens and trust has eroded here.Kaiser has not learned to hire intelligently. The work ethic can be embarrassing to observe.|The most valuable resources of a healthy company are your well-trained employees. Employees with a broad understanding of the company (based on longevity and experience) are your best source to improving efficiency. The best service managers can perform for the company is to note who these employees are and USE them wisely.There are standardized industry tools available for sifting through applicants to determine which ones are hard-wired to be most service oriented. You only need to be served refreshments on an airplane to see this phenomenon at work. The attendants are safety personnel masquerading as waiters. Kaiser would do well to review this methodology of hiring and revamp their techniques.|3.0

You can be ""typed"" and once that happens your career/future can be put on interminable hold.The best (qualified) person for the job is not the person they hire or promote. Most of the time you cannot even obtain an interview. It's all in ""who"" you know from working here for years. New comers can bring a wealth of business knowledge and experience into the environment and it is overlooked because the hiring manager hires a ""favorite"" who they have known for years.Kaiser is in bed with the union. They won't push back on anything. They give the union whatever they ask for when negotiation time comes around. They resolve conflicts between union and salaried staff by hushing the salaried employee in favor of keeping the union happy. Union employees for the most part are slackers and have poor attendance. Sorry but it's true. Nothing is done about it. Salaried employees who work very hard receive lower annual raises and less acknowledgement than union personnel. Extra compensation plan has been suggested to raise attendance of union employees. ie: if they show up for work instead of calling in so often - they will be gifted or bonused. How about firing a few of their asses and that will bring up their attendance! Instead - you buy them gifts to come to work!? You don't see salaried people calling in sick or being bonused for being dependable and producing. You don't even see slaried people being given the same salary increases as the union people.This is a place to work until retirement. Not a place to come to start your career. What a dreadful thought to look back and have only had this work experience in my entire career."|Take a look at your salaried employees and acknowledge that they keep this place running.
